<span class="displaytext"><b>from: howard wolfson, communications director<br/> to: interested parties<br/> date: saturday, april 19, 2008<br/> re: (candidate last) campaign on the attack in last weekend of pennsylvania primary</b> <p>a major theme of sen. (candidate last) on the stump is that (candidate full) is running a negative campaign based on "slash and burn politics" and that he represents a break from that kind of politics. in fact, in just the last 48-hours, sen. (candidate last) has flooded airwaves, radio, phone lines and mailboxes with negative and false attacks against hillary. this unprecedented barrage coincides with a weak debate performance and sen. (candidate last)'s slide in the daily gallup poll. </p><p>1. in the most outrageous attack of the campaign, (candidate last) surrogates held a conference call attacking hillary's character, claiming she did not have the "moral authority" to lay a wreath on the tomb on the unknown soldier. [link] </p><p>2. launched a television ad featuring false, negative attacks on hillary's health care plan. [link] </p><p>3. distributed negative mail about hillary's trade positions, complete with citations even sen. (candidate last) has acknowledged have been debunked. [link] </p><p>4. flooded voters with robocalls saying hillary will "say anything" to win.</p></span>
