<span class="displaytext">after days of misleading denials, sen. (candidate last) has finally acknowledged that a meeting took place between his senior economic advisor and canadian officials regarding nafta. but sen. (candidate last) now claims that the detailed memo obtained by the ap describing the meeting - and goolsbee's downplaying of (candidate last)'s anti-nafta rhetoric - is inaccurate. this is at least the fifth different explanation offered by sen. (candidate last) and his campaign. <p><b>1. 2/27/08 - 'no conversations have taken place' with the canadian government on nafta.</b> "earlier thursday, the (candidate last) campaign insisted that no conversations have taken place with any of its senior ranks and representatives of the canadian government on the nafta issue." [ctv, 2/29/08] </p><p><b>2. 2/27/08 - (candidate last) advisor just said 'hello.'</b> "goolsbee: canada's consul general in chicago contacted him 'at one point to say 'hello' because their office is around the corner." [abc, 2/29/08] </p><p>3.<b> 2/28/08 - rice: 'there had been no contact.'</b> "the canadian ambassador issued a statement that was absolutely false. there had been no contact. there had been no discussions on nafta. so we take the canadians at their word...period." [msnbc, susan rice, 2/28/08] </p><p>4.<b> 2/29/08: sen. (candidate last): 'it did not happen.'</b> anchor: "so, completely inaccurate, did not happen, end of discussion." sen. (candidate last): "it did not happen." [wkyc tv, 2/29/08] </p><p><b>5. 3/10/08 - sen. (candidate last): the meeting did happen, they did discuss nafta, but advisor just said (candidate last) wanted to make nafta 'stronger for u.s. workers.'</b> "so here's what happens. you've got one of my economic advisors goes and visits a canadian embassy and they're asking him questions and he says, 'well, senator (candidate last) isn't planning to repeal nafta, but he wants to amend it to make it stronger for u.s. workers.' the canadian embassy writes it up as, 'well, maybe (candidate last) is not as tough on nafta as you might think.' and the (candidate last)s start waving this and saying, 'see? actually, he's the one.'"
