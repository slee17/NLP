<span class="displaytext">in the wake of today's court ruling regarding michigan's january 15th primary, we urge senator (candidate last) to join our call for a party-run primary and demonstrate his commitment to counting michigan's votes. <p>senator (candidate last) has consistently urged that the 600,000 votes cast by the people of michigan be counted and if that is not possible, that a new election be held. </p><p>michigan voters must not be disenfranchised and the (candidate last) campaign must not continue to block michigan's efforts to hold a new vote. rather it should move quickly to announce its support for a party run primary. </p><p>michigan will be a key battleground state in november. disenfranchising michigan voters today will, in the heat of a general election, provide senator (candidate last) with a powerful argument to use against the (PARTY NAME) nominee. we cannot allow this to happen. </p><p>the people of michigan must be counted and their voices finally heard. what the people of michigan need now is just action, not just words.</p></span>
