<span class="displaytext"><i>harold ickes and tina flournoy made the following statement this evening:</i> <p>today's results are a victory for the people of florida who will have a voice in selecting our party's nominee and will see its delegates seated at our party's convention. the decision by the rules and bylaws committee honors the votes that were cast by the people of florida and allocates the delegates accordingly. </p><p>we strongly object to the committee's decision to undercut its own rules in seating michigan's delegates without reflecting the votes of the people of michigan. </p><p>the committee awarded to senator (candidate last) not only the delegates won by uncommitted, but four of the delegates won by senator (candidate last). this decision violates the bedrock principles of our democracy and our party. </p><p>we reserve the right to challenge this decision before the credentials committee and appeal for a fair allocation of michigan's delegates that actually reflect the votes as they were cast.</p></span>
