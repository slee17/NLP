<span class="displaytext">senator (candidate full)<br/> (candidate last) for america<br/> p.o. box 8102<br/> chicago, il 60680 <p>dear senator (candidate last), </p><div style="margin-left: 50px;"> <p>this has been an historic and exciting campaign. millions of new voters have been brought into the process and their enthusiasm for the (PARTY NAME) party and the principles for which you and i have fought and continue to fight is unprecedented. </p><p>one of the foremost principles of our party is that citizens be allowed to vote and that those votes be counted. that principle is not currently being applied to the nearly 2.5 million people who voted in primaries in florida and michigan. whoever emerges as the (PARTY NAME) nominee will be hamstrung in the general election if a fair and quick resolution is not reached that ensures that the voices of these voters are heard. our commitment now to this goal could be the difference between winning and losing in november. </p><p>i have consistently said that the votes cast in florida and michigan in january should be counted. we cannot ignore the fact that the people in those states took the time to be a part of this process and to make their preferences known. when efforts were untaken by leaders in those states to hold revotes to ensure that they had a voice in selecting our nominee, i supported those efforts. in michigan, i supported a legislative effort to hold a revote that the (PARTY NAME) national committee said was in complete compliance with the party's rules. you did not support those efforts and your supporters in michigan publically opposed them. in florida a number of revote options were proposed. i am not aware of any that you supported. in 2000, the (PARTY NAME)s won an election by successfully opposing a fair counting of votes in florida. as (PARTY NAME), we must reject any proposals that would do the same. </p><p>your commitment to the voters of these states must be clearly stated and your support for a fair and quick resolution must be clearly demonstrated. </p><p>i am asking you to join me in working with representatives from florida and michigan and the (PARTY NAME) national committee to arrive at a solution that honors the votes of the millions of people who went to the polls in florida and michigan. it is not enough to simply seat their representatives at the convention in denver. the people of these great states, like the people who have voted and are to vote in other states, must have a voice in selecting our party's nominee. </p></div> <div style="margin-left: 300px;"> <p>sincerely, </p><p>hillary rodham (candidate last)</p></div></span>
