<span class="displaytext">senator (candidate full) released the following statement commending governor culver signing the midwestern climate change compact: <p>"i applaud governor culver and the people of iowa for signing the midwestern climate change compact. by signing this pact, the people of iowa have made a strong statement that they will not wait for president bush to lead on one of the most pressing issues of our timeâ€”the energy and climate crisis. instead, the people of iowa and the midwest are going to act now to transition to homegrown, cleaner forms of energy and address global warming. </p><p>i have put forward an aggressive plan to reduce global warming pollution by 80 percent below 1990 levels by mid-century. like the midwestern climate change compact, my plan creates a market-based, cap-and-trade system for efficiently allocating pollution permits; establishes a goal of significantly increasing the amount of electricity that comes from renewable sources by 2025; requires new coal plants to have carbon capture and storage technology; increases the number of gas stations with e85 pumps; and places a huge priority on increasing our energy efficiency. </p><p>since president bush won't lead on this issue, states like iowa and others throughout the midwest have stepped up to fill in the gap. when i am president, i will make it a top priority to move our country to energy independence, address global warming, and create five million jobs in the process."</p></span>
