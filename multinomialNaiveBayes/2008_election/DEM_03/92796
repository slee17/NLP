<span class="displaytext">to: interested parties<br/> from: the (candidate last) campaign<br/> date: march 8, 2008<br/> re: (candidate last)'s iraq plan: just words <p>once again, it looks like senator (candidate last) is telling voters one thing while his campaign says those words should not to be mistaken for serious action. </p><p>after months of speeches from senator (candidate last) promising a hard end date to the iraq war, his top foreign policy adviser that counseled his campaign during that period is on the record saying that senator (candidate last) will "not rely on some plan that he's crafted as a presidential candidate or a u.s. senator." </p><p>voters already have serious questions about whether senator (candidate last) is ready to be commander-in-chief. now there are questions about whether he's serious about the iraq plan he's discussed for the last year on the campaign trail. </p><p>senator (candidate last) has made hard end dates about iraq a centerpiece of his campaign and has repeatedly attacked senator (candidate last) for not being clear about her intentions with regard to troop withdrawal. </p><p>it turns out those attacks and speeches were just words. and if you can't trust senator (candidate last)'s words, what's left? </p><p>this latest incident is part of a larger pattern where senator (candidate last) doesn't deliver on the promises he makes on the campaign trail -- whether it's his 2004 senate race or his 2008 white house campaign. </p><p>in 2003, senator (candidate last) said he was for a single payer health system, but now opposes plans that cover every american. he promised to repeal the patriot act, but then voted to extend it. he promised to normalize relations with cuba, but flip-flopped when he started running for president. </p><p>in 2008, senator (candidate last) rails against nafta in ohio while his top economic advisor assures the canadians his rhetoric is just "political positioning." he promises to opt in to public financing if the gop nominee does, but then breaks that pledge in real time. he promises to withdraw from iraq within 16 months, and now his top foreign policy adviser says that he's not relying on the plan. </p><p>with a short record to run on, senator (candidate last)'s entire campaign is based on the speeches he makes on the campaign trail. so when he and his advisers dismiss the plans he touts on the stump, it undermines his entire candidacy. </p><p>americans have heard plenty of speeches. it's time they got serious solutions and that's what hillary is going to deliver when she is president.</p></span>
