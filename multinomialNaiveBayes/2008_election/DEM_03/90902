<span class="displaytext">today is the fourth anniversary of what i consider to be one of the most shameful episodes in american history. <p>never before in our history has a president said 'mission accomplished' when the mission had barely begun. never before has a president landed on the deck of an aircraft carrier to proclaim the end of major combat operations to a war that rages on four years later. never before has a president pulled a political stunt when so many american lives were and remain in harm's way. </p><p>the president took us to a preemptive war of his choosing based on his assessment of faulty evidence and trumped up facts. he ignored the warnings of senior military advisors and he retaliated against those who tried to stop him. and once he got the authority to put inspectors back into iraq, he ignored their findings. it is something that will stand as one of the darkest blots on leadership we've ever had in our nation's history. </p><p>america is ready for a president who will respect our armed forces by properly planning for the missions we ask our troops to undertake. america is ready to end this war and when i am president, that's exactly what i'll do.</p></span>
