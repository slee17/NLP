<span class="displaytext">"for a long time families and community groups have been saying that the subprime mortgage industry was rife with abuses. a federal investigation of industry practices is long overdue. last year, i introduced the home ownership preservation act to curb industry abuses by registering mortgage brokers, eliminating certain lending practices, and providing $100 million in assistance to states to investigate and prosecute mortgage-related fraud. but we must not only end the abusive practices, we must end the foreclosure crisis itself. that is why i have also proposed a 90-day moratorium on subprime foreclosures, a 5-year freeze in rates on subprime adjustable rate mortgages, and $30 billion in assistance to states and communities to fight foreclosures and offset the costs associated with mounting vacancies."</span>
