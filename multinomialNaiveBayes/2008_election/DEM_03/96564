<span class="displaytext">"while there is much to praise in senator (candidate last)'s speech, he and i continue to have a fundamental disagreement on iraq. like president bush, senator (candidate last) continues to oppose a swift and responsible withdrawal from iraq. like president bush, senator (candidate last) discounts the warnings of our senior military leadership of the consequences of the iraq war on the readiness of our armed forces, and on the need to focus on the forgotten front line in afghanistan. like president bush, senator (candidate last) wants to keep us tied to another country's civil war, and said "it would be fine with me" if u.s. troops were in iraq for 50 or even 100 years. that in a nutshell is the bush/(candidate last) iraq policy."</span>
