those relationships have really been strained beyond anything i would have anticipated. another part of (candidate full) that i think is just tremendous is that she knows our reality. she is in touch with people, she listens to people. she decides what she believes about policy based on what's right, she has integrity, and on what works, so she's practical." <b>lieutenant general frederick vollrath</b> </p><p><i>[click here]</i> for audio<br/> "i support senator (candidate last) because i believe it's time for change in our country, a new direction. and i know change carries with it risks. senator (candidate last) is the candidate, in my opinion, with the proven experience that truly understands the risks and how to possibly cope with those risks to get the job done. we shouldn't shirk from change because of the risks, but we absolutely have to have a leader with the proven experience. america, in the area of national defense, must be successful and senator (candidate last) has that experience to create change, to understand the risk, and to get the job done."<br/> <b>vice chairman of the joint chiefs, admiral william owens</b> </p><p><i>[click here]</i> for audio<br/> "in this world that we face today, very complex as all of us know, i think experience will be really at a premium, especially at the level of the commander-in-chief. there's not time to learn. the phone rings and you have to be ready. you have to ready with intuition, with experience and with skills. and this world will have the complexities that perhaps we've never before seen. i've been impressed with and admire (candidate full) for her work in the senate. and we need people with great judgment. i think she brings the best of talent, intuition and experience to handle these unknown threats in the future."</p></span>
