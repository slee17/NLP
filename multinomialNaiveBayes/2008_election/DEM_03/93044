<span class="displaytext">"although the administration is finally giving the foreclosure crisis the attention it deserves, it seems that president bush is going to give struggling homeowners far less than they need. <p>with news accounts using terms like 'whittled down' and 'limited' to describe the scope of the bush plan, it appears that the president is pushing a freeze for a very narrow group of borrowers. that is unfortunate because this crisis demands a more comprehensive approach that is adequate for the scale of the problem. </p><p>"i hope the administration adopts my entire plan and fashions an agreement with the mortgage industry that does three things: <br/> </p><ul> <li style="margain-bottom: 1em;">observe a foreclosure moratorium of at least 90 days on subprime, owner-occupied homes;</li> <br/> <li style="margain-bottom: 1em;">freeze the monthly rate on subprime adjustable rate mortgages, with the freeze lasting at least 5 years or until the mortgages have been converted into affordable, fixed-rate loans; and</li> <br/> <li style="margain-bottom: 1em;">provide status reports on the number of mortgages being modified from destined-to-fail to able-to-work. </li> <br/> </ul> <p>"i look forward to the formal announcement of the bush plan, but i fear that once again the administration has let down the american middle class."</p></span>
