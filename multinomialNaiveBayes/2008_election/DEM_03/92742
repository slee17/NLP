<span class="displaytext">david plouffe, campaign manager<br/> (candidate last) for america<br/> p.o. box 8102<br/> chicago, il 60680 <p>dear david: </p><p>congratulations again on your victories tuesday night. as senator (candidate last) declared, it was a great evening for (PARTY NAME). </p><p>one of the things i've always appreciated about the (PARTY NAME) party is its willingness to engage the toughest issues facing our country, even if we don't always agree on how best to solve them. </p><p>after seven years of a bush administration that has left the economy struggling and our health care system in crisis, americans are certainly facing their fair share of challenges and deserve to hear how the candidates for the nomination will address them. </p><p>as such, i was disappointed to see that senator (candidate last) rejected the idea of having more debates given the fact that he and senator (candidate last) have had only a single one-on-one debate. i think we can do better and so does hillary. </p><p>senator (candidate last) believes voters should have more than one opportunity to see the candidates discuss the issues and has accepted five debates between now and march 4th from cnn, msnbc, wjla, abc and fox news. </p><p>to that end, we hope senator (candidate last) will join senator (candidate last) for a debate a week beginning this weekend. i'm sure we can find a suitable place to meet on the campaign trail. there's too much at stake and the issues facing the country are too grave to deny voters the opportunity to see the candidates up close. </p><p>as senator (candidate last) has said, "in an era when americans are rightfully skeptical about the quality of our politics, let us set an example [they] can be proud of and give them the kind of campaign they deserve." we couldn't agree more. </p><p>sincerely, </p><p>patti solis doyle<br/> campaign manager</p></span>
