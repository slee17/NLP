<span class="displaytext"><b>to: interested parties<br/> from: the (candidate last) campaign<br/> date: march 26, 2008<br/> re: the (candidate last) record: just words</b> <p>yesterday, a pennsylvania editorial board asked sen. (candidate last) how she would have "responded if [her] pastor had said some of the things that rev. wright said?" in response, she said rev. wright would not have been her pastor, an honest view shared by many americans. </p><p>the (candidate last) campaign's response? attack sen. (candidate last) and accuse her of trying to divert attention from the bosnia trip story and her record of foreign policy experience. </p><p>sen. (candidate last)'s response was sincere. the (candidate last) attack was disingenuous. </p><p>we are happy to discuss sen. (candidate last)'s foreign policy experience and her record overall. unfortunately, the (candidate last) campaign doesn't want to discuss its candidate's record and prefers personal attacks instead. </p><p>sen. (candidate last) knows that if he focused on his experience, he'd get questions about the shortcomings in his record and the efforts he has made to embellish it. </p><p>he'd have to deal with the fallout from this week's washington post report on his gross exaggeration of his role on immigration reform and housing policy. </p><p>sen. (candidate last) would have to explain why the new york times reported that he claims credit for passing nuclear leak legislation that never got out of committee. </p><p>he'd have to confront reports from factcheck.org and other independent organizations that say his claims of providing a universal health care plan are based on selective, embellished and out-of-context quotes from newspapers. </p><p>he'd have to discuss the la times story that reported on how his fellow organizers say he took too much credit for his community organizing efforts. </p><p>he'd have to explain why he regularly claims he was a law professor when in fact he held no such title. </p><p>sen. (candidate last) seems to think disingenuous attacks on sen. (candidate last) will address the concerns voters have about his record and readiness to be the commander-in-chief and the steward of our economy. they won't. </p><p>in the end, sen. (candidate last)'s words cannot erase hillary's 35-year record of action because when all is said and done, words aren't action. they are just words.</p></span>
