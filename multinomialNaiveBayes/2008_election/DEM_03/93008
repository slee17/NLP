"that's what i'll be fighting for. but let me be clear, if george bush doesn't end this war before he leaves office...when i'm president, i will." </p><p>according to the plan, if the bush administration does not begin a phased redeployment of troops and convene an international conference within 90 days, it must obtain a new congressional authorization to remain in iraq.

"i know we're at the start of a presidential campaign, but i think all (PARTY NAME) should be focused on working together to push the president to change course."</p></span>
