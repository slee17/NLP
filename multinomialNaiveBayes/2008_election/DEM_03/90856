<span class="displaytext">"we must use all the tools at our disposal to address the serious challenge posed by iran, including diplomacy, economic pressure, and sanctions. <p>"i believe that a policy of diplomacy backed by economic pressure is the best way to check iran's efforts to acquire a nuclear weapons program and stop its support of terrorism, and the best way to avert a war. that's why i took to the senate floor last february and warned the president not to take military action against iran without going to congress first and why i've co-sponsored senator webb's legislation to make that the law of the land. i've been concerned for a long time over george bush's saber rattling and belligerence toward iran. </p><p>"we must work to check iran's nuclear ambitions and its support of terrorism, and the sanctions announced today strengthen america's diplomatic hand in that regard. the bush administration should use this opportunity to finally engage in robust diplomacy to achieve our objective of ending iran's nuclear weapons program, while also averting military action. that is the policy i support."</p></span>
