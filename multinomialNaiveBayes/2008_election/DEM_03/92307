"in the hours after super tuesday's polls closed, contributions began coming in and shortly after sen. (candidate last) discussed a loan she had given her campaign in january, there was a massive surge in contributions from small donors across the country. emails and letters poured in from supporters telling sen. (candidate last) that they hadn't realized that she needed their financial support." </p><p>"the emails ranged from a conservative veteran who wrote to say that he, his wife and daughters all contributed to the campaign, to a couple who decided to forego their valentine's dinner to send a donation. with more than a million volunteer hours committed and millions of dollars donated to sen. (candidate last)'s campaign, our grassroots supporters are the backbone of our campaign. we cannot thank them enough for standing with sen. (candidate last) every step of the way and we know we can rely on them to carry us to victory."</p></span>
