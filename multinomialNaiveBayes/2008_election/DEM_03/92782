<span class="displaytext"><b>date: april 21, 2008<br/> to: interested parties<br/> from: mark nevins, pennsylvania communications director<br/> re: countdown to pa primary </b><p>today, the (candidate last) campaign in pennsylvania unveiled a new television ad that delivers senator (candidate full)'s closing argument in the keystone state. </p><p>in contrast to the negative attacks from the (candidate last) campaign, hillary enters primary day with a positive tv spot that details how tough the job of president is, and asks voters who they think is ready to step in and handle it. senator (candidate last) is doing everything he can to win pennsylvania outright, outspending the (candidate last) campaign by a three to one margin in the state, and sharply attacking senator (candidate last) on the stump and in television, radio, and direct mail pieces. </p><p>you can view the ad here </p><p>meanwhile, senator (candidate last) is spending an estimated $11.2 million to the (candidate last) campaign's $4.8 million in pennsylvania. the $7 million gap in funding between the two campaigns could fund an entire campaign in another state. the (candidate last) campaign is pouring unprecedented amounts of that money into their negative tv, radio and direct mail efforts, as well as paid phone calls. </p><p>if senator (candidate last) is unable to do well here, it will raise questions about his ability to win the large, swing states that he needs to win to take the election in november. </p><p>senator (candidate last)'s negative tactics in pennsylvania are part of a growing pattern seen in other states: when his back is against the wall, he tends to go on the attack. senator (candidate last) would rather throw punches than give thoughtful responses to key concerns from voters. he is going to have to do a much better job at addressing these issues if he wants to convince voters and superdelegates of his ability to win in a general election against (candidate full). </p><p>senator (candidate last) is continuing to criss-cross pennsylvania, talking to voters about the issues that are important to them, like the economy, health care and the iraq war. after 35 years of making change, hillary has the experience to lead the country on day one in the white house. </p><p>the job of a president is tough. hillary has what it takes to handle it.</p></span>
