<span class="displaytext">"equal pay day, the day that women's wages catch up with our male counterparts from the previous year, reminds us that while americans have made great strides towards equality, we still face important challenges. <p>"even forty years after the equal pay act was signed into law, women only receive .77 cents for every dollar men earn, and the gap is significantly more for women of color. in pennsylvania, women who work full time earn 74.8 percent of what men earn. in indiana, its 72.6, and in north carolina women earn 79.7 to each dollar earned by men. on average, families forfeit $4,000 a year because women don't receive equal pay for equal work. i am a proud sponsor of the paycheck fairness act, which will toughen penalties in enforcing the provisions of the equal pay act and help realize the promise of pay equity. </p><p>"there are heroines standing up for equal pay for equal work. lilly ledbetter, whose years of pay discrimination were upheld by the supreme court because she did not file a lawsuit before she had evidence of the discrimination, inspired me and my colleagues to introduce legislation to ensure that cases like hers are decided on the merits not on technicalities. </p><p>"as the voters in pennsylvania go to the polls today, the wage gap is a stark reminder of what is at stake in this election. as president, i will continue to work for pay equity because it's not a woman's issue, it is a fairness issue and it is a family issue."</p></span>
