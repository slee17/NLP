<span class="displaytext">(candidate last) spokesperson mark daley today released the following statement: <p>"the iowa caucus should belong to iowans. while we would never do anything to disenfranchise the many iowans who are working and volunteering on our campaign, it's our long-standing policy that any staffer or volunteer who has come to iowa for the sole purpose of working on the campaign should not be allowed to caucus. we are happy to sign any pledge that affirms that policy of ours."</p></span>
