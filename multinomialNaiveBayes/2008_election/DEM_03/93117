<span class="displaytext">"according to news accounts, treasury secretary paulson said that the administration is putting forward a proposal, as part of its response to the foreclosure crisis, to allow state and local governments to temporarily broaden their tax-exempt bond programs to include mortgage refinancing. <p>"i think this is an excellent idea that the administration should have been adopted two months ago when i proposed it. </p><p>"the mortgage revenue bond program (mrb) needs to be modified to help families replace unworkable adjustable rate mortgages with stable, fixed-rate loans. under the mrb, state housing finance agencies use the proceeds of tax-exempt bond issuances to provide low-cost mortgages to low- and moderate-income families. i proposed to modify the program in two ways to address the foreclosure crisis: first, state agencies would be permitted to use mrbs to refinance mortgages (under current law, mrb funds can only be used for original mortgages). and second, i would increase the federal cap on the mrb program by roughly 25% to provide an additional $2.5 billion in refinancing capacity. </p><p>"policies like my mrb proposal are desperately needed right now. the foreclosure crisis is harming families, communities, and the economy. </p><p>"this morning i wrote to secretary paulson to insist that the administration and the mortgage industry quickly fashion an agreement to end this crisis. i informed the secretary that a satisfactory agreement must do at least three things: <br/> </p><ul> <li style="margain-bottom: 1em;">impose a foreclosure moratorium of at least 90 days on subprime, owner-occupied homes. </li> <br/> <li style="margain-bottom: 1em;">freeze the monthly rate on subprime adjustable rate mortgages, with the freeze lasting at least 5 years or until the mortgages have been converted into affordable, fixed-rate loans. </li><br/> <li style="margain-bottom: 1em;">require the mortgage industry to provide status reports on the number of mortgages it has modified.</li> <br/> </ul> <p>"if the administration fails to produce an agreement adequate to the scale of the problem, i will consider legislation that enables lenders and servicers to convert unworkable mortgages into stable, affordable loans without the permission of investors."</p></span>
