<span class="displaytext">"while the locations it selected are worthy ones, i believe the commission on presidential debates missed a golden opportunity to show new orleans that the entire country is committed to its recovery, by passing it up as a site for a debate. hosting a debate in new orleans would spotlight the city to the rest of world and push to ensure that its rebuilding is not ignored." <p>"getting new orleans back on its feet must be a national priority, as rebuilding new york after 9/11 was. we must get to work on a plan to cut through the red tape, deliver the federal assistance the city was promised, and get services running and infrastructure built in new orleans and across the gulf coast." </p><p>"choosing new orleans as the site of one of our nation's great (PARTY NAME) events would have been a chance to reaffirm this priority, and i'm sorry the commission decided differently."</p></span>
