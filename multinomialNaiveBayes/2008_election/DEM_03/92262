"while senator (candidate last) was telling voters he would fix nafta, his chief economics advisor was telling canadians that his position was just words. instead of making false attacks on (candidate full)'s character, the (candidate last) campaign should finally explain why it continues to mislead voters about mr. goolsbee's meeting with the canadian government." </p><p>the (candidate last) campaign offered at least five different, and frequently contradictory explanations, of goolsbee's meeting with the canadian government. according to a memo produced by the canadian government, goolsbee told the canadians not take (candidate last)'s anti-nafta rhetoric seriously because it was merely "political positioning." </p><p>5.<b> 3/10/08 - sen.
