<span class="displaytext">"i am hopeful that in response to the overwhelming vote by culinary members authorizing action against the grand sierra resort, both sides will recommit to the collective bargaining process and find common ground. not only could this avert a damaging strike, but it would also serve to affirm that strong companies can grow and prosper while protecting quality of life for the working men and women on the front line. <p>"recent successful negotiations to resolve outstanding contract issues in nevada – including the latest with circus circus in reno – prove that the collective bargaining process can work to everyone's benefit. it is my sincere hope that the situation with grand sierra can be similarly resolved."</p></span>
