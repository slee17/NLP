<span class="displaytext">"there are people right now in the world, not just wishing us harm but actively planning and plotting to cause us harm. if the last six years of the bush administration have taught us anything, it's that political rhetoric won't do anything to quell those threats. and that america is ready for a change. <p>"one of the great tragedies of this administration is that the president failed to keep this country unified after 9/11. we have to protect our country from terrorism -- it shouldn't be a (PARTY NAME) fight or a (PARTY NAME) fight. the plain truth is that this administration has done too little to protect our ports, make our mass transit safer, and protect our cities. they have isolated us in the world and have let al qaeda regroup. the next president is going to be left with these problems and will have to do what it takes to make us safer and bring (PARTY NAME) and (PARTY NAME)s together around this common mission of protecting our nation. that is exactly what has to be done and what i am ready to do."</p></span>
