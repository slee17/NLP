<span class="displaytext">in january, nbc's tim russert confronted senator (candidate full) with a four page memo from his campaign characterizing statements they claimed the (candidate last) campaign had made about race. asked in hindsight whether he regretted pushing this story, senator (candidate last) said: <p><i>well, not only in hindsight, but going forward. i think that, as hillary said, our supporters, our staff, get overzealous. they start saying things that i would not say. and it is my responsibility to make sure that we're setting a clear tone in our campaign, and i take that responsibility very seriously, which is why i spoke yesterday and sent a message in case people were not clear that what we want to do is make sure that we focus on the issues."</i> </p><p>we agreed then. we agree today. supporters from both campaigns will get overzealous. senator (candidate last) today reiterated that when asked about geraldine ferraro's recent comments: </p><p><i>"i do not agree with that and you know it's regrettable that any of our supporters on both sides say things that veer off into the personal. we ought to keep this focused on the issues. that's what this campaign should be about."</i> </p><p>senator (candidate last)'s campaign staff seems to have forgotten his pledge. we have not. and, we reject these false, personal and politically calculated attacks on the eve of a primary. this campaign should be about the leadership we need for a better future and these attacks serve only to divide the (PARTY NAME) party and the american people.</p></span>
