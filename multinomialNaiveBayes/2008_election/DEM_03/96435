<span class="displaytext">isea southwest uniserv unit president tom mclaughlin, a resident of council bluffs, career educator, and candidate for isea vice-president, issued the following statement in response to senator (candidate last)'s conference call today: <p>"senator (candidate last) has worked tirelessly to support early childhood education, improve teacher training, lower class sizes, fully fund no child left behind, and reward innovative thinking in education. she also understands the challenges our teachers face in the classroom everyday and has been an advocate to support the work of educators at every level. she understands that the focus of education should be on student learning beyond a single standardized test and that test scores alone should not be used to punish schools, teachers, and most importantly students by cutting funding or salaries. this is a defining issue in this campaign with senator (candidate last) being the only (PARTY NAME) candidate to support merit pay, which is not a good policy for teachers or students. as president, (candidate full) will continue to proudly support efforts to fund and improve our educational system. senator (candidate last) is the clear choice for voters interested in the best education system for our state's students." <br/> <br/> </p><p>*mclaughlin's endorsement reflects his personal decision and does not indicate the support of the isea, which will not endorse a presidential candidate.</p></span>
