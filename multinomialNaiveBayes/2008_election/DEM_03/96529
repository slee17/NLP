<span class="displaytext"><i>for more information, please visit</i> http://facts.hillaryhub.com/archive/?id=6072. <p>"when it comes to the housing crisis, senator (candidate last) sounds a lot more like president bush than a (PARTY NAME) candidate for president. in fact, senator (candidate last) has positioned himself to the right of george bush on this issue. senator (candidate last) knows it's going to take a lot more than speeches to fix the housing crisis. she knows we need a candidate who has a plan that acknowledges that the housing market is broken, and who has the strength and experience to propose a moratorium and rate freeze to help americans get back on their feet. additionally, senator (candidate last)'s proposed $10 billion foreclosure fund is a mere one-third the size of senator (candidate last)'s, yet another failure on his part to acknowledge the size and scope of this crisis. when senator (candidate last) says that senator (candidate last)'s plan will "reward people who are <u>wealthy and don't need it</u>" he shows himself to be out of touch with average americans. senator (candidate last)'s plan only helps subprime borrowers, a population that is disproportionately low-income."</p></span>
