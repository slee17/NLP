<span class="displaytext">today's news that our economy grew at an anemic 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2007 reinforces my fear that we are sliding into a recession. this data confirms that for far too many families, the state of the union is a state of economic anxiety. <p>i have been calling since early december for congress and the president to take immediate action to jumpstart our economy. i am heartened to see that the house moved quickly to pass a stimulus package. but we need more than tax rebates and business incentives to fix our ailing economy. that is why i have called for extending unemployment insurance for those who are looking for work, expanding heating assistance for those facing skyrocketing heating cost, and enacting a comprehensive solution to the housing crisis, including a 90-day foreclosure moratorium and a 5-year interest rate freeze on subprime mortgages.</p></span>
