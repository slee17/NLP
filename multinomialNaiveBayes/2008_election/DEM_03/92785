<span class="displaytext"><b> to: interested parties<br/> from: mark penn<br/> date: october 19, 2007<br/> re: how hillary will win the west </b><p>the western united states. the fastest growing region in the country. the largest number of new immigrants. home to las vegas, silicon valley, napa valley, hollywood and our largest national parks, the source of most of america's fruit, beef and wine and much of our oil, land of dot-coms, ranches and retirement communities - rapidly becoming the most diverse part of america. </p><p>hillary country. </p><p>hillary has generated excitement in arizona, colorado, nevada, washington, california and across the west, where she's given thousands of supporters the chance to see her up close. and the endorsements keep rolling in: former washington governor gary locke, los angeles mayor antonio villaraigosa, california assembly speaker fabian nuã±ez, colorado house speaker andrew romanoff, california senator dianne feinstein, oakland mayor ron dellums, former denver mayor wellington webb, california controller john chiang, as well as arizonan raul yzaguirre, former president of the national council of la raza, the leading hispanic advocacy organization in the country. </p><p>nowhere is hillary's western strength more evident than in nevada, where a recent poll shows her breaking 50% in the primary and leading by 37 points. </p><p>and her support among local leaders only continues to grow, including: clark county commissioner rory reid, former governor bob miller, senate minority leader dina titus, former las vegas mayor jan jones, state treasurer kate marshall, assembly majority leader john oceguera, dr. robert fowler, clark county commissioner chris giunchigliani, former attorney general frankie sue del papa, las vegas latin chamber of commerce chairman robert gomez and reno-sparks indian colony chairman arlan menendez.. </p><p>this summer, hillary has drawn huge crowds across the silver state, including 3,500 in reno, more than 3,000 in las vegas and even 2,500 in rural pahrump—where she's opened a regional field office. </p><p>the (candidate last) campaign has brought the hillary tour to most of the western states, and has a strong on-the-ground presence with offices, field organizers, and thousands of volunteers spanning the region. </p><p>and the west is turning out to be a stronger region for (candidate full) than anyone anticipated. </p><p><b> 1. hillary is winning </b></p><p>(PARTY NAME) primary  </p><p>hillary leads the (PARTY NAME) primary by more than 20 points in the west, with an

won in 2004, and in california, oregon and washington. </p><p>together with hawaii, this means (candidate full) is starting with two-thirds of the electoral votes in the west. </p><p>and because of her unique ability to take advantage of changing demographics, hillary can also turn colorado, arizona, nevada and montana from red to blue. bill (candidate last) was the only (PARTY NAME) since 1968 to win these states, and (candidate full) is the only (PARTY NAME) positioned to win them in 2008. </p><p>hillary has an 8 point lead over (candidate full) nationally in the latest abc/washington post poll, and she leads by more than 40 points among latinos, 18 points among women, 13 points among moderates and more than 80 points among african-americans in that poll and other recent polls – all

</td></tr> </table> <p><b> 2. why hillary is winning </b></p><p>changing demographics  </p><p>two key groups help explain why the west is breaking for hillary: latinos and women. they were the swing voter groups whose movement towards bush gave him victory in 2004 and whose support will be vital to a (PARTY NAME) victory in 2008. and hillary has stronger support among these groups than any other (PARTY NAME) or (PARTY NAME) candidate. </p><ul> <li> <i>latinos favor (candidate full) by more than 30 points in the (PARTY NAME) primary and more than 40 points in the general election. </i> </li><li> women made up 54 percent of the electorate last time, and they make up an even bigger slice of the (PARTY NAME) primary – including 59 percent in arizona, where the last two governors were both women. <i>women favor (candidate full) by more than 40 points in the (PARTY NAME) primary and 18 points in the general election. </i> </li><li> an overwhelming 94 percent of young women say they would turn out to vote for the first woman president because it would be important to them. and a 10 percent increase in women turning out for (candidate full) alone would flip new mexico, nevada and colorado to the (PARTY NAME). </li></ul> <p>these demographic trends are a big part of the reason (PARTY NAME) recently picked up a us senate seat in montana, the colorado governor's race, house seats in colorado, arizona and california and the oregon state legislature. </p><p><b> hillary's message and lifetime of achievement on issues that matter to western voters </b> </p><p>why are westerners so excited about (candidate full)? because on the issues that matter to western voters – like sensible immigration reform, environmental protection, alternative energy, yucca mountain, choice, health insurance for children, reducing the budget deficit and ending the iraq war – hillary is the only candidate with the experience and record of accomplishment to get the job done. </p><p>and hillary has been reaching out to women and latinos more than any other campaign – with a bilingual website and a website for women for hillary, and extensive national and local outreach to both of these core groups, communicating her historic message of change, leadership and experience. </p><p>the old adage says as goes the west so goes the country. if that's true, it's just another sign that (candidate full) is poised to win.</p></span>
