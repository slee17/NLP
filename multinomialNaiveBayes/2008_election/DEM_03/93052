<span class="displaytext">washington, dc -- "tonight i voted against the emergency supplemental appropriations bill because it fails to compel the president to give our troops a new strategy in iraq. i believe that the president should begin a phased redeployment of our troops out of iraq and abandon this escalation. i fully support our troops, and wish the president had followed the will of the people and signed the original bill we sent which both funded the troops and set a new course of phased redeployment. but the president vetoed congress's new strategy and so congress must reject the president's failed policies. i will also continue to press with senator byrd for our legislation to end the authorization of the war in iraq. <p>"while i am deeply disappointed that the supplemental does not provide for a new course in iraq, i want to recognize the many worthy parts of this bill: funding to help those sickened in the aftermath of 9/11, additional relief for katrina and rita victims, homeland security funds for high-threat cities like new york city, resources to protect parts of new york affected by recent flooding, $650 million for the state children's health insurance program, and the first federal minimum wage increase in ten years. i support these measures but cannot support this emergency supplemental which will not change our course in iraq."</p></span>
