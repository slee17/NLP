<span class="displaytext"><b>to:</b> interested parties<br/> <b>from:</b> mark penn, chief strategist<br/> <b>date:</b> tuesday, december 11, 2007<br/> <b>subject:</b> new penn poll memo <p>two new national polls are out that show hillary maintaining a strong national lead among (PARTY NAME) and likely (PARTY NAME) primary voters. </p><p>the abc/washington post poll shows hillary continuing to climb against (candidate full) and (candidate full) to a 30 point lead. the cbs/ny times poll gives hillary a 17 point lead. the ap/ipsos poll a few days earlier had a 22-point lead. it is typical for polls to vary, especially when polling primaries, but these margins are all way beyond the margin of error. </p><p>the abc/washington post poll is particularly strong - showing how hillary beats (candidate last) and others on every single issue and almost every core attribute related to being president. </p><p>and these polls show that voters very much believe that hillary is the most electable candidate out there. in the cbs/new york times poll, 63% say (candidate full) has the best chance of winning the general election in november, compared with 14% for (candidate full) and 10% for (candidate full). </p><p>the abc/washington post poll shows that there has been a big rise in concern about the economy (44% now say it is one of the two most important issues, up from 29% last month) and healthcare (27% say it is one of the two most important issues, up from 22% last month). concern about the war is down from 45% to 37%, but the iraq war remains the number two issue, and (candidate full) has a plan to end the war quickly and responsibly, and is the candidate voters trust most on iraq (51%, compared with 26% or less for (candidate last) and (candidate last)). </p><p>but the voters are also showing their concern about healthcare and the economy and these are issues where hillary particularly shines with the voters. in the abc/washington post poll, 60% said they trust (candidate full) most on healthcare, compared with 16% or less for (candidate last) and (candidate last), and 58% said they trust hillary most on the economy, compared with 18% or less for (candidate last) and (candidate last). as voters focus on the growing importance of these issues, it in fact works to hillary's advantage because those are issues where they see her as a very strong and experienced leader.</p></span>
