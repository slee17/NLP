<span class="displaytext">"i am deeply concerned about the violent clashes that have erupted in lhasa, tibet. based on the limited information available, there is an urgent need for all parties, and in particular the chinese security forces, to exercise restraint, to demonstrate respect for human rights and to protect civilians from danger. i call on the chinese government to prevent further escalation of this conflict and to urgently pursue resolution through peaceful means. <p>"i co-sponsored the fourteenth dalai lama congressional gold medal act and co-sponsored the tibetan policy act of 2001, supporting a dialogue between the people's republic of china and the dalai lama. i have personally met with the dalai lama. i asked president jiang zemin to explain china's repression of the tibetans and their religion during his 1997 state visit to the united states. more than 10 years later, chinese repression in tibet continues. this week, tibetan monks have sent a message to the world that their aspirations for religious liberty remain as strong as ever. </p><p>"upholding freedom and human rights in tibet will happen through negotiation, and with a commitment on all sides to seeking constructive solutions for the benefit, above all, of the tibetan people."</p></span>
