<span class="displaytext">"the sharp increase in the number of people in the u.s. with hiv is extremely alarming and further demonstrates that much work needs to be done to address the hiv/aids crisis in this country." <p>"throughout my time in the senate, i have fought for increased funding for prevention, treatment, supportive services and research, but we need a leader in the white house who will take this issue head on and develop the solutions we need." </p><p>"as president, i will implement an aggressive national strategy. we need to ensure that we are doing everything possible to prevent new infections. i will put an end to the bush administration's abstinence-only prevention policy, and instead, fund evidence-based hiv/aids prevention programs including, but not limited to, abstinence education as part of a comprehensive prevention message. i have also proposed a doubling in the hiv/aids research budget within the national institutes of health (nih) to $5.2 billion annually, and my american health choices plan will ensure that all americans living with hiv/aids have access to care." </p><p>"i believe with leadership and smart investments we can significantly reduce the number of new infections and develop treatments that turn hiv/aids into a chronic but manageable condition."</p></span>
