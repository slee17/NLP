<span class="displaytext">today, the people of guam made their voices heard and turned out in historic numbers to help pick our next president. i am grateful to the many people of guam who voted for me and worked so hard to make today a success. i want to congratulate senator (candidate last) for running a vigorous campaign in guam and look forward to our next contests in indiana and north carolina. <p>while our campaign was dramatically outspent, we had an impressive grassroots-oriented effort. with the help of dedicated volunteers, thousands of people became energized by the idea of a brighter future for all guamanians. today's results further demonstrate that voters from philadelphia to dededo want a leader who will take swift action to get our nation back on track. i will be that president. </p><p>after seven years of the bush administration, guamanians need someone who will stand up and fight for them. i will be that president and have outlined my solutions to improve the lives of families in guam. just this past week, i sought justice on behalf of filipino veterans, who may finally have access to the benefits that have been unfairly withheld from them for over six decades. </p><p>i have also been a strong proponent of the guam world war ii loyalty recognition act, which recognizes the sacrifices of the people of guam who demonstrated steadfast loyalty to our country despite extraordinary hardships and suffering during the japanese occupation of guam. and i have a plan to ensure quality, affordable health care to every single resident of guam and other territories. </p><p>as our campaign moves forward after this day, i will continue to champion the issues facing the people of guam and when i'm president i will ensure that hard-working families of guam have the resources and the opportunity to succeed.</p></span>
