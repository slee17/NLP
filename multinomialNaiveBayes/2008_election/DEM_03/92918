"we are not supposed to be pledged." </p><p>clyburn has not said which (PARTY NAME) he supports for the white house. he is one of the party's superdelegates - the people who are not assigned to a candidate based on primary or caucus success, unlike normal delegates. </p><p>clyburn, the third highest-ranking (PARTY NAME) in the u.s. house of representatives, said he thinks superdelegates should wait to announce their support for candidates until closer to the nominating convention. he said the historical role of a superdelegate is in part to be ready to act in case of an emergency, like to throw support behind a runner-up in case a front-runner cannot continue after the convention. </p><p>"we're supposed to be playing the role of being there as a safety valve, if something were to go wrong," clyburn said. "they are there to make whatever midcourse correction needs to be made, and that's the role that we're supposed to play." </p><p>as of thursday, the overall delegate count stood at 1,276 for (candidate full) and 1,220 for hillary rodham (candidate last), though she leads in superdelegate support. </p><p>while clyburn said he'd prefer superdelegates not announce their support until much later in the nominating process, he said he also doesn't agree with superdelegates shifting support from one candidate to another based on how their constituents vote in a primary or caucus. </p><p>he addressed the issue several days after a former (candidate last) supporter announced his intent to vote for (candidate last) at the (PARTY NAME) national convention. georgia rep. david scott said he felt compelled to change his allegiance after more than 80 percent of his district voted for the illinois senator in the feb. 5 georgia primary. </p><p>clyburn said superdelegates are not in place simply to mirror the popular vote. "i don't think people are really thinking through what they're saying," he said. </p><p>it takes 2,025 to clinch the nomination - a number clyburn said friday he didn't think either candidate will be able to reach before the convention. the august convention in denver is where the superdelegates will have their say, he said. </p><p>"nobody is going to have 2,000 votes when this is over," clyburn said.
