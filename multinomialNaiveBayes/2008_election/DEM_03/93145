<span class="displaytext">"today i received a petition from more than 85,000 americans who are members of the one campaign. i applaud their activism and share their urgent concern for the challenges of poverty and aids, especially in africa. i want to assure the one campaign and all americans that i am committed to aggressively combating poverty and disease around the world. i support the bipartisan renewal of the pepfar program, and as president i will go further. i have called for spending at least $50 billion over the next five years to fight aids worldwide. i have also called for spending $10 billion over five years to get kids in school around the world, and have committed to the bold goal of ending malaria deaths on the continent of africa by the end of my second term. i am also committed to visiting africa during my first term as president, to see the progress of our efforts and to assess first hand the necessary strategies to combat disease and poverty. i look forward to working with the one campaign and other organizations when i am president to ensure that addressing the needs of the world's poorest countries is an essential component of our nation's foreign policy."</span>
