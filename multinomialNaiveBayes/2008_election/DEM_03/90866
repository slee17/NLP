<span class="displaytext">"today, million of americans will come together for the 57th annual national day of prayer. i joined this morning with a group of ministers. our prayers were for our nation and for strength and wisdom to be good leaders. it is important that we all recognize that praying for our country, praying for people in positions of authority is what people of faith are called upon to do. this is a day about unity and common ground as our prayers in all their diversity of faiths can bring us together in our common goals for our families, communities and our nation."</span>
