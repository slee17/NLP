<span class="displaytext">"this morning, (candidate full) said that four more years of the same strategy will produce victory in iraq, though he provided no new approach or new proposals. this is not the first time senator (candidate last) has predicted victory in iraq. he promises more of the same bush policies that have weakened our military, our national security, and our standing in the world. our country cannot afford more empty promises on iraq. when i am president, the united states will no longer give iraq a blank check. i will bring this war to a swift and honorable conclusion, and bring our troops home, beginning within 60 days of taking office."</span>
