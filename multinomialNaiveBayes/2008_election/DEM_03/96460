<span class="displaytext">two polls that had the race within a few points before the iowa caucuses have the race tied after the iowa caucuses. <p>in today's cnn/wmur poll, (candidate full) and senator (candidate full) are tied at 33 percent - their last two polls had hillary up 4 points and before that had hillary down 2 points, so there is no statistically significant change in their numbers before and after the iowa caucuses. </p><p>and the concord monitor is out as well today with a poll showing the race at 33 percent for (candidate full), 34 percent for (candidate full) and 23 percent for (candidate full) - exactly the same margin as before iowa. </p><p>contrast that with the 17 points john kerry gained in 2004 in the boston globe poll, which catapulted him from a 17-point deficit to a 20-point lead in new hampshire after the iowa caucuses. or with the 7 points al gore gained in 2000 in the cnn/usa today/gallup poll, increasing his lead in new hampshire from 5 points to 18 points. </p><p>new hampshire voters are fiercely independent. they will make their own decisions about who to support.</p></span>
