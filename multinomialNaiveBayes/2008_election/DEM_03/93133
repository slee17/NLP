<span class="displaytext">"in 1995, i went to beijing and said, 'Â˜it is time for us to say here in beijing, and for the world to hear, that it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights.' we have made some progress since then. but we have not made enough. the latest example is the punishment of 200 lashes that a saudi arabian court has given to a victim -- the victim -- of a gang rape. this is an outrage. the bush administration has refused to condemn the sentence and said it will not protest an internal saudi decision. i urge president bush to call on king abdullah to cancel the ruling and drop all charges against this woman. as president i will once again make human rights an american priority around the world."</span>
