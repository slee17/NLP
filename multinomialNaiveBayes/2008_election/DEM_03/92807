<span class="displaytext"><b>to: interested parties<br/> from: the (candidate last) campaign<br/> date: april 22, 2008<br/> memo: watch what they do, not what they say</b> <p>the (candidate last) campaign is attempting to pre-spin the results from tonight's pennsylvania primary by suggesting that sen. (candidate last) should - and will - win. </p><p>but after the (candidate last) campaign's "go-for-broke" pennsylvania strategy, after their avalanche of negative ads, negative mailers and negative attacks against sen. (candidate last), after their record-breaking spending in the state, a fundamental question must be asked: why shouldn't sen. (candidate last) win? </p><p>sen. (candidate last)'s supporters - and many pundits - have argued that the delegate "math" makes him the prohibitive frontrunner. they have argued that sen. (candidate last)'s chances are slim to none. so if he's already the frontrunner, if he's had six weeks of unlimited resources to get his message out, shouldn't he be the one expected to win tonight? if not, why not? </p><p>as the phrase goes, watch what they do not what they say. </p><p>there's a reason sen. (candidate last) and his campaign have ratcheted up their year-long assault on sen. (candidate last)'s character and ended the pennsylvania campaign with a flurry of harsh negative attacks. it's because they know that a loss in pennsylvania will raise troubling questions about his candidacy and his ability to take on (candidate full) in the general election. and it's because they know that the race is neck and neck and tonight's contest is a measure of where the campaign stands. </p><p>the reality is this: both candidates need a combination of pledged and super delegates to secure the nomination - and either candidate can reach the required number. the press and the pundits have repeatedly counted sen. (candidate last) out and she has repeatedly proved them wrong. the vote in the bellwether state of pennsylvania is another head to head measure of the two candidates and of the coalition they will put together to compete and win in november. </p><p>no amount of spin from the (candidate last) campaign will change that - nor will it explain away anything less than a victory by sen. (candidate last).</p></span>
