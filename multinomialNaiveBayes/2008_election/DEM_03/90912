<span class="displaytext">washington, dc -- "with his veto today, president bush has made it clear that he is standing in the way of ending the war in iraq and bringing our troops home. the nation is ready for the president to stop disregarding the will of the american people and to work with (PARTY NAME) on a funding bill that will enable us to begin redeploying our troops. he has a chance to do just that when he meets with the (PARTY NAME) leadership tomorrow. <p>"it has been four years since the president declared an end to major combat operations. it is my hope that the president will approach this next round of talks in good faith. </p><p>"i am also disappointed that with his veto, the president has taken us back a step in meeting the homeland security needs of our high-threat cities like new york city and vetoed $35 million in additional funding under the urban area security initiative. </p><p>"in addition, with his veto, the president has shirked his responsibility to address the growing health needs affecting those exposed to the toxic air around ground zero in the wake of 9/11 and vetoed $50 million in funding for 9/11 health, which would not only have helped provide treatment to those affected in the new york metro area, but also to responders from all over the country who are suffering from 9/11 health effects. this funding would have helped meet immediate health needs and allow 9/11 health programs to continue operating. despite the president's actions today, i will continue to fight, along with my colleagues in the new york delegation, to secure the federal commitment and funding required to meet 9/11 health needs in the long-term. </p><p>"the president has also chosen to veto critical legislation that would have ended the practice of giving department of homeland security (dhs) contractors bonuses for incomplete or sub-par work, thereby saving taxpayers millions of dollars."</p></span>
