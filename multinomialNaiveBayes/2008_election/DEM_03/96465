<span class="displaytext">"senator (candidate last) began calling for stimulus over a month ago, and last week became the first candidate to unveil a detailed, aggressive stimulus plan to give confidence and immediate support to struggling middle class families. we are heartened to see that senator (candidate last) has followed senator (candidate last)'s lead and announced a stimulus package that borrows heavily from senator (candidate last)'s, but it nonetheless comes up short." <p>"any effective stimulus plan must include a comprehensive effort to end the housing crisis, which is dragging down our economy and putting millions of homeowners at risk. senator (candidate last)'s package offers substantially more assistance to mitigate the effects of mounting foreclosures than senator (candidate last)'s plan. it also offers an aggressive plan to end the foreclosure crisis by imposing a moratorium on subprime foreclosures and a freeze in subprime mortgage rates. senator (candidate last) has been leading on the housing issue for much of the year now, and has presented a comprehensive agenda that will help families refinance unworkable loans and ensure that responsible families are able to get mortgages."</p></span>
