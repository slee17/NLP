<span class="displaytext">bronx, ny - at a press conference today on the need for kinship care legislation at the grandparent family apartments in the bronx, ny, senator hillary rodham (candidate last) gave the following statement in response to a question about halliburton's announcement that it will shift its corporate headquarters from the u.s. to dubai: <p>"we just heard news that this company that vice president cheney used to be in charge of called halliburton, has decided to move corporate headquarters overseas and i think that raises a lot of serious issues we have to look at. does this mean they are going to quit paying taxes in america? they are going to take all the advantage of our country but not pay their fair share of taxes? they get a lot of government contracts - is this going to affect the investigations that are going on? because we have a lot of evidence of misuse of government contracts and how they have cheated the american soldier and cheated the american taxpayer. they have taken the money and not provided the services, so does this mean that we won't be able to pursue these investigations? i think it raises a lot of very big concerns and i think we are going to be looking into that in washington. i think it is disgraceful that american companies are more than happy to try to get no-bid contracts like halliburton has and then turn around and say we are not going to stay with our chief executive officer or the president of our company in the u.s. anymore. well i am proud to be an american and i am proud to be part of the greatest country in the world."</p></span>
