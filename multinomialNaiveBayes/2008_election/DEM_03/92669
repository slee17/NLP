<span class="displaytext"><strong>victory in west virginia</strong>: hillary won the west virginia primary by a 41-point margin, earning 67 percent of the vote...in her victory speech, she told supporters that "there are some who have wanted to cut this race short. they say 'Â˜give up, it's too hard, the mountain is too high,' but here in west virginia, you know a thing or two about rough roads to the top of the mountain... i'm in this race for the millions of americans who know that we can do better in our country, for the nurse on her second shift, for the worker on the line, for the waitress on her feet, for the small business owner, the farmer, the teacher, the coal miner, the trucker, the soldier, the veteran, the college student." read more. <p><strong>in case you missed it:</strong> watch communications director howard wolfson on the significance of hillary's west virginia victory: "this isn't just a small victory, this is a huge victory. the media has been telling voters: (candidate full) is the presumptive nominee. it's all over. give up. don't come out and vote. and yet, in overwhelming numbers, they've come out and voted for senator (candidate last) tonight." <i>[watch here.]</i> </p><p><strong>why west virginia matters: </strong>"the mountain state is used to picking winners. every nominee has carried the state's primary since 1976, and no (PARTY NAME) has won the white house without winning west virginia since 1916. (PARTY NAME) carried west virginia in 1992 and 1996, but lost the state - and the white house - in 2000 and 2004. hillary has predicted victory against sen. (candidate last) in west virginia based on the strength of her economic message. given the attempts by our opponent and some in the media to declare this race over, any significant increase in voter turnout, coupled with a decisive (candidate last) victory, would send a strong message that (PARTY NAME) remain excited and energized by hillary's candidacy." read more. </p><p><strong>hitting the airwaves: </strong>hillary appears on national news programs today including abc world news, cbs evening news, cnn's situation room with wolf blitzer, fox news, nbc nightly news, and noticiero univision. </p><p><strong>by the numbers: </strong>a new abc news/washington post poll shows that "more than six in 10 (PARTY NAME)...64 percent...say (candidate last) should remain in the race." a usa today poll also shows a majority of (PARTY NAME) want hillary to continue.
