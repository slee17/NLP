those relationships have really been strained beyond anything i would have anticipated. another part of (candidate full) that i think is just tremendous is that she knows our reality. she is in touch with people, she listens to people. she decides what she believes about policy based on what's right, she has integrity, and on what works, so she's practical." </p><p><b>lieutenant general frederick e. vollrath</b> </p><p><i>[click here]</i> for audio </p><p>"i support senator (candidate last) because i believe it's time for change in our country, a new direction. and i know change carries with it risks. senator (candidate last) is the candidate, in my opinion, with the proven experience that truly understands the risks and how to possibly cope with those risks to get the job done. we shouldn't shirk from change because of the risks, but we absolutely have to have a leader with the proven experience. america, in the area of national defense, must be successful and senator (candidate last) has that experience to create change, to understand the risk, and to get the job done." </p><p><b>major general paul d. eaton</b> </p><p><i>[click here]</i> for audio </p><p>"on a personal note, i have a special forces captain son and a sergeant paratrooper both in afghanistan. i find senator (candidate last) the perfect choice to be their commander-in-chief and to display the loyalty to command our armed forces and to rebuild them after the conflicts in which we are engaged right now." </p><p><b>major general antonio m. taguba</b> </p><p><i>[click here]</i> for press release </p><p>"senator (candidate last)'s unequivocal opposition to the use of torture under any circumstances, and her willingness to take a stand for what she believes in is exactly the sort of courage and moral strength that we need in our leaders. i know that, as president, senator (candidate last) will hold america to the high moral standards that have made us a leader among nations." </p><p><b>brigadier general john m. watkins, jr.</b> </p><p><i>[click here]</i> for audio </p><p>"as i think about the challenges facing the nation and having been in uniform for almost thirty years, worked with a number of presidents to include the last four, i can't think of a single person - those generals included - who is better qualified to walk into the oval office than (candidate full). i don't make that statement very lightly. she is more qualified, in my view, than her husband bill was when he entered the office. it is no surprise to me that you would have as many flag officers who serve this country and secretaries of the army and navy who have served this country who would come out and support hillary." </p><p>the full list of admirals and generals who have endorsed senator (candidate last) to be our next commander-in-chief follows: </p><p>1. general wesley clark<br/> 2. general john m. shalikashvili<br/> 3. general henry hugh shelton<br/> 4. general johnnie e. wilson<br/> 5. vice chairman of the joint chiefs, admiral william owens<br/> 6. lt. gen. joe ballard<br/> 7. lt. gen. robert gard<br/> 8. lt. gen. claudia kennedy<br/> 9. lt. gen. donald kerrick<br/> 10. lt. gen. frederick e. vollrath<br/> 11. vice admiral donald c. arthur<br/> 12. vice admiral joseph a. sestak, jr.<br/> 13. major general roger r. blunt<br/> 14. major general george buskirk, jr.<br/> 15. major general edward l. correa, jr.<br/> 16. major general paul d. eaton<br/> 17. major general paul d. monroe, jr.<br/> 18. major general antonio m. taguba<br/> 19. brigadier general john w. douglass<br/> 20. brigadier general michael dunn<br/> 21. brigadier general belisario flores<br/> 22. brigadier general evelyn "pat" foote<br/> 23. brigadier general keith h. kerr<br/> 24. brigadier general virgil a. richard<br/> 25. brigadier general preston taylor<br/> 26. brigadier general john m. watkins, jr.<br/> 27. brigadier general jack yeager<br/> 28. rear admiral connie mariano<br/> 29. rear admiral stuart f. platt<br/> 30. rear admiral alan m. steinman<br/> 31. rear admiral david stone</p></span>
