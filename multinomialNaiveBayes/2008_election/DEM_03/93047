<span class="displaytext">washington, dc -- "this afternoon, a bipartisan group of senators, who have been working closely in conjunction with the administration, announced that they had reached an agreement on a comprehensive approach for reforming our broken immigration system. <p>"as i have long maintained, comprehensive immigration reform must have as essential ingredients a strengthening of our borders, greater cross-cooperation with our neighbors, strict but fair enforcement of our laws, federal assistance to our state and local governments, strict penalties for those who exploit undocumented workers, and a path to earned legal status for those who are here, working hard, paying taxes, respecting the law, and willing to meet a high bar. in particular, we must also ensure that any bill protects the sanctity of families and does not lead to the creation of a new underclass in our country. </p><p>"i will scrutinize carefully the proposed compromise to see if it honors our nation's principles and proud immigrant heritage while also respecting the rule of law."</p></span>
