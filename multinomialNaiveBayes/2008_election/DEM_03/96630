<span class="displaytext"><i>robert kennedy jr. issued the following statement this evening:</i> <p>"it is clear from the context that hillary was invoking a familiar political circumstance in order to support her decision to stay in the race through june. i have heard her make this reference before, also citing her husband's 1992 race, both of which were hard fought through june. i understand how highly charged the atmosphere is, but i think it is a mistake for people to take offense."</p></span>
