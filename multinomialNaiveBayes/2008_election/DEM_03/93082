<span class="displaytext">in response to the u.s. senate rejecting the lilly ledbetter fair pay act, a bill that would have provided american women with the legal recourse to challenge workplace discrimination when it occurs, (candidate full) issued the following statement: <p>"i was proud to be an original co-sponsor of this legislation, which would help deliver on the promise of equality and fairness in the workplace, and i am deeply disappointed 42 of my colleagues did not see fit to pass it. i am particularly disappointed that senator (candidate last) skipped the vote on this important legislation, and indicated that he would not have supported it had he been there. </p><p>"senator (candidate last) has yet again fallen in line with president bush while middle class families are falling by the wayside. senator (candidate last) would rather pass laws to cut corporate taxes by $100 billion more - than pass laws to protect the civil rights of women earning thousands less than their male counterparts. women are earning less but senator (candidate last) is offering more of the same. </p><p>"as president, i will never waver in my support for equal pay for equal work. i'm proud to be the sponsor of the paycheck fairness act, which would increase sanctions for violating the equal pay act and provide stronger protections for women whose rights have been violated. i think it's long past time we put equal pay at the top of the national legislative agenda, to demonstrate that as a nation, we value the skill, talent and hard work of every american, including every american woman."</p></span>
