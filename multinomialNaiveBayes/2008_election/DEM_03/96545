<span class="displaytext">"last night made clear that there has been a momentum shift in this race. despite being outspent two-to-one, despite sen. (candidate last) benefiting from outside political funds, and despite all of the glowing press coverage he received leading up to march 4th, voters ultimately chose senator (candidate last). i am confident that hillary is heading into pennsylvania with momentum and a new energy. <p>"the people of pennsylvania are focused on the two largest issues facing our nation - the state of our economy and national security. on both counts, pennsylvanians understand how important it is to elect someone who is truly ready to become president and commander-in-chief. hillary is ready to lead our nation, returning us to both prosperity and peace. </p><p>"we look forward to making our voice heard in the coming days and playing our part in determining the (PARTY NAME) nominee. and when we do, the people of pennsylvania will send a clear message - we want a president who is ready, not one we hope will one day be ready."</p></span>
