<span class="displaytext"><b>to: interested parties<br/> from: the (candidate last) campaign<br/> date: april 15, 2008<br/> re: tax day test: is sen. (candidate last) as transparent as he claims?</b> <p>for all of sen. (candidate last)'s rhetoric about the need for tax return transparency, you'd think he'd have released all of his tax records. guess again. </p><p>for weeks, sen. (candidate last) and his campaign relentlessly demanded that hillary release all of her tax returns even though 20-years of them were already publicly available. his campaign held an endless string of conference calls, issued press releases and flooded the airwaves with surrogates attacking hillary for not immediately releasing the returns for the last few years she has been in public life. </p><p>sen. (candidate last) said the american people "deserve to know where you get your income from," stressing the need for "full transparency" and bragging that his campaign has "set the bar." </p><p>well, hillary released tax returns earlier this month and is now the only candidate in this race who has made thirty years worth of tax returns public. </p><p>but despite his rhetoric, sen. (candidate last) doesn't abide by the standards he sets for others. </p><p>sen. (candidate last) has refused to release his tax returns for 1997, 1998 and 1999, even though he was in public life as a state senator during those years. during this period of time, sen. (candidate last) was accepting contributions from special interest lobbyists, pacs and even directly from corporations. </p><p>in fact, sen. (candidate last) has a habit of demanding higher standards of transparency for others than for himself. the national archives has released hundreds of thousands of pages of documents from hillary's years as first lady, including her entire schedule. throughout the campaign, sen. (candidate last) has demanded hillary release more documents, even though they are not under her control. meanwhile, sen. (candidate last) refuses to release any documents that are more than three years old. at first, sen. (candidate last) and his campaign told the press that he had records from his state senate years. later, he said he threw them all out. </p><p>whether it's tax returns or legislative records or his relationship with indicted political fixer tony rezko, senator (candidate last) seems to take "the dog ate my homework" approach to disclosure. </p><p>when it comes to transparency, the only thing transparent about senator (candidate last) is his claim to be transparent.</p></span>
