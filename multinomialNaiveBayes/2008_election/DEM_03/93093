<span class="displaytext"><i>(candidate full) made the following statement at the hispanic chamber of commerce earlier this morning:</i> <p>"if you are a voter from florida or michigan, you know that we should count your vote. the nearly two and a half million americans in those two states who participated in the primary elections are in danger of being excluded from our (PARTY NAME) process and i think that's wrong. the results of those primaries were fair and they should be honored. over the last few weeks, there has been a lot of discussion about what we should do to ensure that the voters in florida and michigan are counted. </p><p>"in my view there are two options: honor the results or hold new primary elections. i don't see any other solutions that are fair and honor the commitment that two and a half million voters made in the (PARTY NAME) primaries in those two states. whether voters are clamoring for solutions to the challenges that we face or not, or whether people are coming out in droves to be heard, we have a basic obligation to make sure that every vote in america counts. </p><p>"i hope that senator (candidate last)'s campaign will join me in working to make that happen. i think that that is a non-partisan solution to make sure that we do count these votes."</p></span>
