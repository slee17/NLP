<span class="displaytext">columbus, oh - (candidate full) issued the following statement today in response to a question about press reports that senator (candidate last)'s campaign offered private assurances to canadian officials downplaying his anti-nafta rhetoric. <p>"you'll have to ask senator (candidate last). i think it's somewhat disturbing that he would say one thing in ohio and then have his campaign send a private signal to a foreign government which is presenting exactly the opposite of what he's been saying in ohio. this is part of a pattern and i think it's a pattern that deserves closer examination. nafta is a really critical issue to the people of ohio. i have not just talked about the problems with nafta; i've put forth a very specific plan about what i would do to correct them. i made it clear in the debate that i would tell both canada and mexico that we would opt-out if they did not negotiate. i feel that strongly about it. we've had it for 14 years. there are parts of the country that are doing well and other parts that are really suffering. and we should make this as much of a win/win for america as possible. so there's no doubt about where i stand or where my campaign stands."</p></span>
