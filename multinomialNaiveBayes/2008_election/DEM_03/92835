<span class="displaytext">today a group of montana leaders released a letter decrying comments made last friday by sen. (candidate full) widely seen as offensive towards rural america. <p><b>background:</b> at a fundraiser in san francisco last week, senator (candidate last) shared his views of americans from small towns: "it's not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations." </p><p><i>text of the letter from montana leaders follows: </i> </p><p>we wish to express our sincere disappointment with comments made by sen. (candidate full) at a private san francisco fundraiser last week - comments which demean the heritage and values of working montanans. </p><p>sen. (candidate last)'s views are offensive to rural montanans who work everyday to provide for our families, lift up our communities and strengthen our state and country. </p><p>we embrace our faith not out of frustration but as a foundation of the values that guide us - the values we have inherited and the values we pass on. </p><p>montanans are hunters. many montanans feel the second amendment is a part of our heritage as sportsmen and recreationists. it is not something we 'Â˜cling to' out of bitterness. </p><p>we have faced difficult times, but montanans are resilient, optimistic and unwavering in our commitment to our families and country. </p><p>after seven years of a president who refused to talk to us, the last thing we need is a presidential candidate who talks down to us. </p><p>sen. (candidate last)'s remarks also serve to drive us further apart instead of uniting us around the great challenges we face together. we need good-paying jobs. we need an end to this war. we need health care for every american. but to meet these challenges, we need a president who respects and honors our values. </p><p>we are intelligent, optimistic people who believe in a better america. we need a president who stands up and fights for us, and shares our can-do spirit. that is what montanans will be looking for when we go to the polls on june 3rd. </p><p>sincerely, </p><p>former representative pat williams<br/> state senate majority leader carol williams<br/> state senator carol juneau<br/> representative bill wilson<br/> representative diane sands<br/> representative shannon augare<br/> senate pro tempore dan harrington<br/> former state senator dorothy eck</p></span>
