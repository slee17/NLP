<span class="displaytext"><strong>why hillary is the strongest candidate:</strong> in a letter to all superdelegates, hillary outlines her case for why she believes she is the strongest candidate: "i believe i am best prepared to lead this country as president â€“ and best prepared to put together a broad coalition of voters to break the lock (PARTY NAME)s have had on the electoral map and beat senator (candidate last) in november." <p><strong>swing-state advantage: </strong>according to gallup: "in the 20 states where (candidate full) has claimed victory in the 2008 (PARTY NAME) primary and caucus elections (winning the popular vote), she has led (candidate full) in gallup poll daily trial heats for the general election over the past two weeks of gallup poll daily tracking by 50% to 43%. in those same states, (candidate full) is about tied with (candidate last) among national registered voters, 45% to 46%...in contrast, in the 28 states and the district of columbia where (candidate last) has won a higher share of the popular vote against (candidate last) in the 2008 (PARTY NAME) primaries and caucuses, there is essentially no difference in how (candidate last) and (candidate last) each fare against (candidate last)...all of this speaks to sen. (candidate last)'s claim that her primary-state victories over (candidate last) indicate her potential superiority in the general election." read more. </p><p><strong>a champion for native americans: </strong>at a campaign stop in kyle, sd yesterday, hillary spoke to a "mostly native audience of about 350 people" and pledged to fight for the issues that affect native american veterans as well as all native american families.
