<span class="displaytext"><b>new hampshire for hillary announces 225 more granite state educators for hillary</b> <p><b> manchester, nh </b>– joining more than 500 educators for hillary, new hampshire's commissioner of education, dr. lyonel tracy today announced his endorsement for hillary for president. one week after announcing 312 educators for hillary, the new hampshire for hillary campaign today announced the names of 225 more educators from the granite state who support senator (candidate last)'s run for president. </p><p>"senator (candidate last) has proven time and again that she is a leader in education," said dr. lyonel tracy. "her work as first lady in arkansas to help set public school standards along with her efforts to reform no child left behind put her leagues ahead of other presidential candidates. as president, she will be the advocate our nation's educators need." </p><p>as an advocate, first lady, and united states senator, hillary has fought to raise the education standards in our nation's schools. hillary is committed to reforming no child left behind (nclb). in addition to fighting for full funding for nclb, she is working to ensure the legislation supports early childhood education, improves teacher training, lowers class size, enhances parental involvement, eliminates environmental hazards in schools, and protects the programs that work for america's children. </p><p>senator (candidate last) is also working actively to secure full funding for head start, a program that has helped prepare children to succeed in school by providing comprehensive services addressing all the barriers children in poverty face. </p><p>recently, hillary proposed a plan to make college accessible and affordable for all americans. by providing a $3,500 tuition tax credit—more than 50% of the cost of tuition at the average public institution—and increasing pell grants, hillary's plan will unlock the doors to higher education for millions of young americans. in addition, hillary will simplify the student aid process and strengthen incentives for students interested in public service. </p><p>hillary believes that investing in early childhood education is essential. studies show that universal pre-kindergarten programs pay for themselves after nine years and produce a growing annual return in the years beyond. that is why senator (candidate last) has proposed a plan to provide universal pre-kindergarten program to serve all of america's four-year-olds. her plan would expand access to the more than 3 million 4-year-olds who are not enrolled in state pre-kindergarten programs. it would provide states with matching funds to devise their own programs and requiring that classes be taught by highly-trained teachers. </p><p>"i am honored to have the support of dr. tracy and these dedicated men and women who have undertaken the critically important job of educating new hampshire's children," said senator (candidate last). "with their help, i will continue working to ensure that americans have access to the quality education they deserve from early childhood on." </p><p>dr. lyonel tracy was appointed commissioner of education for new hampshire in 2005. dr. tracy has over 20 years of experience in the field of education. prior to his appointment as commissioner, dr. tracy served as superintendent of schools in portsmouth, president of the new england association of school superintendents and chair of the new hampshire parent teacher association's education committee. </p><p>a complete list of the 225
