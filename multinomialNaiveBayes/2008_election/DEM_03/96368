<span class="displaytext">washington-- (candidate full) celebrated mother's day today by calling for health care for every child in america, urging congress to pass the children's health first act and give mothers the gift of peace of mind. the campaign also posted a video of hillary discussing the important role her mother played in her life, and encouraged supporters to send mother's day ecards through hillary's website. <p>"nothing keeps mothers up at night more than worrying whether their children will have the health care they need if they get sick," (candidate last) said. "we have a moral obligation to our children to give them a healthy start in life." </p><p>(candidate last) introduced the children's health first act in march to extend coverage to the 9 million uninsured children across the country. as president, she is committed to providing affordable, quality health care for all americans. </p><p>according to the kaiser family foundation, the ranks of the uninsured are growing--low-income children made up 23% of the 1.3 million newly uninsured between 2004 and 2005. and children without insurance face far more difficult lives, as needed care is more likely to be postponed and they are less likely to see a physician or dentist for standard preventive care. uninsured children admitted to the hospital due to injuries are twice as likely to die while in the hospital as their insured counterparts. </p><p>hillary's legislation allows states to expand children's health coverage to families up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level (which is $70,000 for a family of three) through the state children's health insurance program (schip) and receive increased federal payments. </p><p>her bill includes incentives for states to expand children's health care to those who are not eligible, and identify and enroll uninsured kids that already qualify for coverage. the bill offers a new affordable coverage option for both families and employers by allowing them the opportunity to buy health insurance coverage through schip. and it provides new incentives to strengthen and protect employer-sponsored coverage, something more than 50 percent of children enjoy today.</p></span>
