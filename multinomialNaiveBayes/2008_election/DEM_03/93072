<span class="displaytext">"this week, we remember the millions of men, women, and children who perished during the holocaust; and as we do, we ask, 'what must we do to ensure that this kind of destruction will never happen again?' <p>"we reflect on the lives that were lost, the courage of those who stood up to the nazis, like the heroes of the warsaw ghetto uprising; and those of all faiths who risked everything to save lives. on this somber day, i am also reminded of the holocaust survivors that came to this country, and who have greatly enriched our nation with their talent, energy, and dreams. their stories and their willingness to share them will guarantee that future generations will never forget. </p><p>"the lessons of the holocaust call us to act. as my friend, elie wiesel, said, '...to remain silent and indifferent is the greatest sin of all...' let us today renew our pledge that we will not be indifferent to moral injustice in the world; that we will not remain silent; and that we will speak out against crimes against humanity, threats of extermination, and genocide, such as that now being perpetuated in darfur. we must act so that we may truly say to the world, 'never again.'"</p></span>
