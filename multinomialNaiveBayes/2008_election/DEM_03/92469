(candidate last) speaks to each with depth and clarity, articulating, say, the value of universal health coverage or ways to repair the troubled student loan program. </p><p>"this race hardly has left room for fiscal discipline, amid all the promises and plans. yet (candidate last) has demonstrated the most restraint. she articulates an approach overseas that involves this country playing a leading role, yet finding ways to work with others, understanding that issues such as combating terrorism, curbing climate change and opening trade require global strategies... </p><p>"one frequently noted virtue of (candidate full) is that she is battle-tested, ready for whatever the (PARTY NAME)s throw at their opponent. actually, she is tested in a more telling way. neither (candidate full), nor (candidate full), nor (candidate full) has much direct management experience. still, of the three, (candidate last) has been on the scene in the governor's office and in the white house, alert to the pace and the breadth of the job. that makes a difference. she understands well the unique demands of the presidency... </p><p>"if both candidates represent a certain change, one seeking to become the first black president, the other the first woman president, the country is best-served by the president with the knowledge, savvy and temperament to push washington forward, building coalitions at the political center. (candidate full) carries much promise of doing so. (candidate full) is the more proven leader."</p></span>
