<span class="displaytext">"i am deeply concerned about efforts in missouri and at least 19 other states to erect even higher barriers to voting than indiana's unnecessary and unfair voter identification law - a law that the supreme court unfortunately upheld last month. by trying to require not just photo identification but proof of citizenship - proof that thousands of american citizens can't produce through no fault of their own - cynical (PARTY NAME) lawmakers are trying to build new walls between hundreds of thousands of eligible senior, minority, and low-income americans and their civil right to choose their own leaders. <p>"(PARTY NAME)s claim that these requirements are needed to prevent fraud, but the reality is that they do little more than disenfranchise eligible voters. i believe that we should start from the premise that voting is a right, not a privilege, and we should make sure that the ballot box is open to every eligible citizen in our country. that is why i have been a strong and vocal opponent of these voter id measures."</p></span>
