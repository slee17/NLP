<span class="displaytext"><i>earlier today, in an exchange with (candidate last) campaign strategist david axelrod on this week with george stephanopoulos, howard wolfson called on the (candidate last) campaign to release all records and correspondence relating to tony rezko. </i><p>tony rezko goes on trial tomorrow for corruption charges in chicago. </p><p>how many fund-raisers did mr. rezko throw for senator (candidate last)? what did senator (candidate last) do for mr. rezko? did he write letters for him? what projects of his did he support? how many business meetings did he attend where mr. rezko had business associates there? one more important one - what are the full details of this very unusual real estate transaction that mr. rezko and mr. (candidate last) entered into? </p><p>what i would suggest to my friend david - and he is my friend - they should put out all of the information regarding that real estate transaction, all of the e-mails, all of the correspondence, all of the letters, every single piece of information so that the public can really look at this and say, "what's going on here?"</p></span>
