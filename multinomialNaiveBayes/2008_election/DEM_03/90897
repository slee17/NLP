<span class="displaytext">senator (candidate last) issued the following statement on president bush's decision to commute the sentence of scooter libby: <p>"today's decision is yet another example that this administration simply considers itself above the law. this case arose from the administration's politicization of national security intelligence and its efforts to punish those who spoke out against its policies. four years into the iraq war, americans are still living with the consequences of this white house's efforts to quell dissent. this commutation sends the clear signal that in this administration, cronyism and ideology trump competence and justice."</p></span>
