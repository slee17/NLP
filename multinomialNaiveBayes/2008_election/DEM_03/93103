<span class="displaytext">"only in george bush's economy could the standard for analyzing the jobs report become "it could have been worse." losing 20,000 jobs in april is completely unacceptable. it marks the fourth straight month of job loss, and means we have now lost more than a quarter-million jobs in 2008. this job loss is hitting families at a time when they are already facing record gas prices, record declines in home values and skyrocketing costs for everything from food to health care. <p>"we need a president who understands that a good job is the ticket to the american dream, and who will fight every day for an economy that creates, not loses, jobs. that's what my campaign is about: jobs, jobs, jobs and jobs. and it is why i am focused on providing struggling middle class americans real relief right now, with extended unemployment insurance, a $30 billion emergency housing fund, and having the big oil companies pay the gas tax this summer instead of families."</p></span>
