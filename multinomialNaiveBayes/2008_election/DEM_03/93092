<span class="displaytext">"today, the court turned its back on the promise of brown vs. board of education that students of different racial backgrounds deserve an opportunity to attend school together. at a time when our nation's schools are increasingly resegregating, we should be championing local efforts to pursue integration and reduce racial inequities in schools. <p>on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the valiant struggle to integrate little rock central high school, let us remember the millions who marched, fought and even paid the ultimate price to help ensure every child in america has an opportunity to attend diverse, high-quality schools." </p><p>"these decisions take away the right of local communities to ensure that all students benefit from racially diverse classrooms. recent evidence shows that integrated schools promote minority academic achievement, and can help close the achievement gap." </p><p>"once again, the roberts court has shown its willingness to erode core constitutional guarantees. it is a set back for all of us who are on the long march toward racial equality and the building of a stronger more unified america. as president, i will fight to restore brown's promise and create an education system where all children have an equal chance to learn and excel together."</p></span>
