<span class="displaytext"><b>corzine and bayh say hillary has best chance to win in their states</b> <p>with less than a month before the iowa caucuses, the (candidate last) campaign is getting help from several elected officials, who say that hillary is the best candidate to defeat the (PARTY NAME) nominee in november 2008. in december, governor jon corzine of new jersey and u.s. senator evan bayh of indiana are expected to campaign on behalf of (candidate last) to discuss her strength as the (PARTY NAME)' general election candidate. governor corzine will kick-off the effort today with campaign stops in oskaloosa, newton, and des moines. </p><p>"(candidate full) is the strongest (PARTY NAME) candidate to defeat the (PARTY NAME) nominee. we know this because (candidate full) has been through the (PARTY NAME) attack machine and has come out stronger," said governor corzine. "she's the only one who is beating mayor (candidate last) in the must win states of new york and new jersey. no (PARTY NAME) can win the white house without those two states." </p><p>(candidate full) won her first senate race in 2000, even after being outspent by her (PARTY NAME) opponents 2-1, and built on that success in her re-election bid in 2006, when she won 58 of the state's 62 counties, including counties that had gone for george bush just two years earlier. she also helped elect three freshman representatives mike arcuri, kirsten gillibrand, and john hall, who all asked hillary to campaign with them multiple times against their (PARTY NAME) incumbent opponents. </p><p>"the lesson of hillary's success is that she will bring core (PARTY NAME) out to vote, while picking up independents and even some (PARTY NAME)s â€“ exactly what she helped do last year," said senator bayh. "this country needs big changes and (candidate full) has the strength and experience to bring that change. she knows how to bring people together to get things done." </p><p>(candidate full) is battle-tested and the polls show it. she currently leads (PARTY NAME) candidates in states george bush won in 2004, including ohio, florida, iowa, missouri, arkansas, virginia, west virginia, kentucky and tennessee. the latest gallup poll also shows that (candidate full) would be the strongest (PARTY NAME) nominee against any potential (PARTY NAME) opponent, winning by a margin from five to 16 points. </p><p>it's not just (candidate full)'s national name recognition that is showing that she is the stronger candidate. in massachusetts, where voters get to see a lot of the candidates early on due to its proximity to new hampshire and where senator (candidate last) has been running advertising, he would barely defeat mayor (candidate last) and would be defeated by senator (candidate last). alternatively, (candidate full) beats all of her potential (PARTY NAME) opponents by solid margins. massachusetts has not gone for a (PARTY NAME) candidate in the last ten presidential elections. </p><p>as a senator, (candidate full) has demonstrated her ability to work across the aisle on issues like body armor for troops and health care for our national guards. but, she also knows how to stand up and fight, as she did when she opposed president bush's attempt to privatize social security. </p><p>"(PARTY NAME) cannot afford to lose another election," said governor corzine. "(candidate full) knows what it takes to win, hit the ground running as president and start making the changes this country needs from day one."</p></span>
