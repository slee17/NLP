<span class="displaytext">to: interested parties<br/> from: the (candidate last) campaign<br/> date: may 6, 2008<br/> re: tie-breaker <p>in april, (candidate full) called indiana a 'Â˜tie-breaker' for the (PARTY NAME) nominating process: "you know, sen. (candidate last) is more favored in pennsylvania and i'm right now a little more favored in north carolina, so indiana right now may end up being the tiebreaker. so we want to work very hard in indiana." </p><p>at the time, senator (candidate last)'s comments seemed to be part of an elaborate plan to lower expectations for the indiana contest. after all, roughly 20% of indiana (PARTY NAME) primary voters have been exposed to senator (candidate last) for years because they live within the chicago media market. he's never lost a state that borders his home-state of illinois. </p><p>the fact that indiana was an open primary - (PARTY NAME)s and independents can vote in the (PARTY NAME) contest - also augured well for senator (candidate last). he has regularly argued that he should be nominated because he "appeal[s] to (PARTY NAME)s and independents in a way that none of the other nominees can." </p><p>throw in the fact that senator (candidate last) outspent the (candidate last) campaign by a 2 to 1 margin on indiana television and indiana seems to be more of a lean-(candidate last) state than a toss-up. </p><p>so hillary's victory in indiana - fought out against the backdrop of an ailing economy - is all the more incredible. we started out behind in both the public and internal polls. </p><p><b>for example, our march 13 poll showed hillary trailing by 8 points, while our latest poll gave hillary a 5 point lead.</b> </p><p>we saw (candidate full)'s margin flip from -19 points among men in indiana back in march to +1 among men in our final poll. among women, hillary's margin increased from +1 in march to +8 now. </p><p>similarly, in mid-february, the howey-gauge poll had (candidate full) 15 points ahead of (candidate full) (feb 16-17: (candidate last) 40 / hrc 25). by april 23-24, hillary had narrowed the gap to only 2 points in the same poll ((candidate last) 47 / hrc 45). the late momentum was critical - according to the exit poll, hillary won by 18 points among those who made their decision in the last three days. </p><p>hillary won by appealing to voters in almost every key demographic group. according to the exit poll, hillary won among men and among women, in northern, central and southern parts of the state, among those who earn more than $50,000 per year and those who earn less, union voters and non-union voters, suburban and rural voters, churchgoers, gun-owners, and those who have not graduated from college. </p><p>hillary also won among those who say the economy is the most important issue, those who are affected by the recession, those who say health care is most important, electability and experience voters. hillary also led (candidate last) on commander-in-chief. </p><p>what drove hillary's strong support - especially among downscale voters, suburban and rural voters, churchgoers, gun-owners and those who are affected by the recession? </p><ul> <li>gas tax summer holiday - making oil companies pay the gas tax instead of american families through a tax on oil company windfall profits</li> <li>tough stance on nafta and other trade issues</li> <li>the only candidate - (PARTY NAME) or (PARTY NAME) - with a health care plan that covers every american</li> <li>support for cutting middle-class taxes</li> </ul></span>
