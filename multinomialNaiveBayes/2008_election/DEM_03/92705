"as president, she will ensure that people of all backgrounds, including those in the aapi community, have the opportunity to receive a quality education and achieve the american dream." </p><p>according to the state data center of iowa, in 2005, there were over 49,000 aapis living in iowa, representing 1.7% of the population. while aapis do have a higher median income compared to all other iowans, they also have a higher rate of poverty, 13.9%, and also experience a higher high school drop-out rate. </p><p>"the aapi community will be of critical importance in this election," said cyndi chen, a community activist from des moines. "now more than ever, asian americans want a president who will deliver on the promise of lowering school drop-out rates, providing affordable health care to every american, and working to eradicate poverty. i know hillary will deliver." </p><p>these leaders in the aapi community have united behind hillary because she is the most qualified and experienced candidate to end the war in iraq, give every american health insurance, and make college more affordable. across the hawkeye state, the asian american pacific islander leadership council will work to increase aapi participation in the caucuses for hillary. iowans for hillary is the first presidential campaign to release a list of aapi supporters. </p><p>"the aapi community can play an important role during the iowa caucuses," said iowa state representative swati dandekar. "we know that these caucuses will be very competitive and the participation of the aapi community could prove to be the difference. hillary has always stood with us, and i look forward to standing for her on january 3rd." </p><p>in the senate, hillary has championed numerous initiatives to improve the lives of aapis, their families and communities. last year, hillary introduced the access to employment and english language acquisition act to provide more job training funds for individuals with limited english language skills. as president, (candidate full) will promote an agenda that provides the opportunity, support and tools that aapis need to realize the american dream and address the challenges facing the community, including discrimination, language barriers, and access to affordable health care. </p><p><b> iowa asian american pacific islander leadership council for hillary: </b></p><p></p><ul><li> tom baccam of des moines, polk county, activist </li><li> calvin baccam of des moines, polk county, mediator </li><li> nina baccam of des moines, polk county, activist </li><li> ihn (joe) baccam of mt. pleasant, henry county, activist </li><li> theresa backham of des moines, polk county, activist </li><li> cyndi chen of des moines, polk county, community activist </li><li> arvind dandekar of marion, linn county, president and ceo, fastek international </li><li> swati dandekar of marion, linn county, representative </li><li> khuong kham baccam of mt. pleasant, henry county, engineer </li><li> khamlo khounlo of storm lake, buena vista county, community leader </li><li> bounkham khounlo of davenport, scott county, engineer </li><li> amanda luong of des moines, polk county, activist </li><li> may-may ng of waukee, dallas county, activist </li><li> sai oumlokham of urbandale, polk county, activist </li><li> vannavong phhabmixay of des moines, polk county, activist </li><li> don phommachackr of des moines, polk county, activist </li><li> navindra sikka of cedar rapids, linn county, community activist </li><li> sudesh sikka of cedar rapids, linn county, community activist </li><li> amar sinha of west des moines, polk county, community activist </li><li> barry thongvanh of storm lake, buena vista county, pastor </li><li> dhirendra vajpeyi of cedar falls, blackhawk county, professor of international politics at uni </li><li> dinh vanlo of des moines, polk county, executive director of tai village </li><li> william wang of iowa city, johnson county, chairman of pharmacom corp. </li><li> cheng xiong of des moines, polk county, activist </li> </ul></span>
