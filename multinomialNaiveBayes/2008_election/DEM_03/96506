<span class="displaytext">"i respect caroline and teddy's decision but i have made a different choice. while i admire senator (candidate last) greatly, i have known (candidate full) for over 25 years and have seen first hand how she gets results. as a woman, leader, and person of deep convictions, i believe (candidate full) would make the best possible choice for president. she shares so many of the concerns of my father. hillary has spent a lifetime speaking out on behalf of the powerless and working to alleviate poverty, in our country and around the world. i have seen her work up close and know she will be a great president. at this moment when so much is at stake at home and overseas, i urge our fellow americans to support (candidate full). that is why my brother bobby, my sister kerry, and i are supporting (candidate full)."</span>
