<span class="displaytext">in another sign of hillary's growing support across oregon, the (candidate last) campaign today announced the endorsement of more than 50 local elected officials from across the beaver state. <p>"i am grateful to have such strong support across all of oregon," said senator (candidate full). "i am committed to talking about the issues that matter to oregonians - from creating new 'green collar' jobs, to protecting our environment and standing up for oregon's rural communities." </p><p>these endorsements come on the heels of the (candidate last) campaign's statewide grassroots push this weekend as ballots arrived. over the weekend, the (candidate last) campaign held community canvasses in all 36 counties and hosted 88 women for hillary house parties to celebrate 88 years of women's suffrage. </p><p>"after eight years of george w. bush, we need a president who can immediately start to clean up his mess and start solving problems again," said eugene state representative sara gelser. "i'm supporting hillary because she is the candidate who is best suited to beat (candidate full) in the fall and bring our country back." </p><p>"i believe that (candidate full) is the best choice for all oregonians," said milwaukie mayor jim bernard. "throughout this primary, she has listened to oregonians. her oregon compact reflects the knowledge and experience that comes from decades in public service. and her proposal for two oregon debates shows that she is not taking our state for granted. i couldn't be prouder to be supporting hillary." </p><p>"i'm proud to be standing with hillary," said greenhorn mayor frances villwock. "hillary has been fighting for change for the past 35 years and i know she is our best candidate to take on the (PARTY NAME)s in november. hillary is also the only candidate with a plan for truly universal healthcare." </p><p>"hillary has the strength and experience to start solving the big challenges we face on day one," said lincoln city councilor doug holbrook. "she has reached out directly to oregonians and talked about the issues that are important to us. hillary has the strength and experience to put her plan for truly universal healthcare into action. hillary isn't taking oregon for granted and i'm proud to be supporting her." </p><p><b>full listed of local elected officials endorsing hillary: </b> </p><p>ted kulongoski, governor <br/> darlene hooley, united states congress <br/> vicki walker, state senator <br/> ginny burdick, state senator <br/> laurie monnes anderson, state senator <br/> sara gelser, state representative <br/> deborah boone, state representative <br/> mitch greenlick, state representative <br/> carolyn tomei, state representative <br/> diana simpson, sheriff, benton <br/> annabelle jaramillo, commissioner, benton <br/> martha schrader, commissioner, clackamas <br/> mike dugan, district attorney, deschutes <br/> bill dwyer, commissioner, lane <br/> lonnie roberts, commissioner, multnomah <br/> desari strader, commissioner, washington <br/> maria rojo de steffey, commissioner, multnomah <br/> james white, mayor, depoe bay <br/> john mcardle, mayor, independence <br/> les paustian, mayor, heppner <br/> jerry cole, mayor, rainier <br/> linda malone, mayor, sandy <br/> cheri olson, mayor, north plains <br/> john oberst, mayor, monmouth <br/> lori hollingsworth, mayor, lincoln city <br/> susan walker, mayor, nyssa <br/> tom hughes, mayor, hillsboro <br/> james w. lewis, mayor, jacksonville <br/> james bernard, mayor, milwaukie <br/> frances villwock, mayor, greenhorn <br/> mary schamehorn, mayor, bandon <br/> kathryn harrington, metro councilor, portland <br/> betty taylor, city councilor, eugene <br/> markley drake, city councilor, happy valley <br/> cynthia o'donnell, city councilor, hillsboro <br/> carrie nelson, city councilor, hood river <br/> nancy lodge, city councilor, independence <br/> rick brissette, city councilor, lincoln city <br/> doug holbrook, city councilor, lincoln city <br/> patricia daniels, city councilor, corvallis <br/> deborah barnes, city councilor, milwaukie <br/> mike claassen, city councilor, bandon <br/> betty bode, city councilor, beaverton <br/> charlie crawford, city councilor, philomath <br/> marion brown, city councilor, falls city <br/> cathy stanton, city councilor, beaverton <br/> charlie crawford, city councilor, philomath <br/> william beers, city councilor, rufus <br/> sharon nolan, city councilor, rufus <br/> sydney sherwood, city councilor, tigard <br/> don clyde, city councilor, bay city <br/> sam steidel, city councilor, cannon beach</p></span>
