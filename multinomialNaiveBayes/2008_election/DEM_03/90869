<span class="displaytext">i am disappointed that president bush has decided to send the colombia free trade agreement to congress. as i have said consistently for several months, i oppose signing any trade deal with colombia while violence against trade unionists continues and the perpetrators are not brought to justice. the united states should be pursuing trade agreements that promote human rights and worker rights, not overlook egregious abuses. <p>i will vote against the president's colombia trade agreement, and will urge my senate colleagues to do the same.</p></span>
