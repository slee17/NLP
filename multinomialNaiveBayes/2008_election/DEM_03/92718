<span class="displaytext">once again, the (candidate last) campaign is getting caught saying one thing while doing another. they are personally attacking hillary even though sen. (candidate last) has been found mispeaking and embellishing facts about himself more than ten times in recent months. senator (candidate last)'s campaign is based on words –not a record of deeds – and if those words aren't backed up by facts, there's not much else left. <p>"senator (candidate last) has called himself a constitutional professor, claimed credit for passing legislation that never left committee, and apparently inflated his role as a community organizer among other issues. when it comes to his record, just words won't do. senator (candidate last) will have to use facts as well," (candidate last) spokesman phil singer said. </p><p><b>sen. (candidate last) consistently and falsely claims that he was a law professor.</b> the sun-times reported that, "several direct-mail pieces issued for (candidate last)'s primary [senate] campaign said he was a law professor at the university of chicago. he is not. he is a senior lecturer (now on leave) at the school. in academia, there is a vast difference between the two titles. details matter." in academia, there's a significant difference: professors have tenure while lecturers do not. [hotline blog, 4/9/07; chicago sun-times, 8/8/04] </p><p><b>(candidate last) claimed credit for nuclear leak legislation that never passed.</b> "(candidate last) scolded exelon and federal regulators for inaction and introduced a bill to require all plant owners to notify state and local authorities immediately of even small leaks. he has boasted of it on the campaign trail, telling a crowd in iowa in december that it was 'the only nuclear legislation that i've passed.' 'i just did that last year,' he said, to murmurs of approval. a close look at the path his legislation took tells a very different story. while he initially fought to advance his bill, even holding up a presidential nomination to try to force a hearing on it, mr. (candidate last) eventually rewrote it to reflect changes sought by senate (PARTY NAME)s, exelon and nuclear regulators. the new bill removed language mandating prompt reporting and simply offered guidance to regulators, whom it charged with addressing the issue of unreported leaks. those revisions propelled the bill through a crucial committee. but, contrary to mr. (candidate last)'s comments in iowa, it ultimately died amid parliamentary wrangling in the full senate." [new york times, 2/2/08] </p><p><b>(candidate last) misspoke about his being conceived because of selma.</b> "mr. (candidate last) relayed a story of how his kenyan father and his kansan mother fell in love because of the tumult of selma, but he was born in 1961, four years before the confrontation at selma took place. when asked later, mr. (candidate last) clarified himself, saying: 'i meant the whole civil rights movement.'" [new york times, 3/5/07] </p><p><b><i>la times</i>: fellow organizers say sen. (candidate last) took too much credit for his community organizing efforts.</b> "as the 24-year-old mentor to public housing residents, (candidate last) says he initiated and led efforts that thrust altgeld's asbestos problem into the headlines, pushing city officials to call hearings and a reluctant housing authority to start a cleanup. but others tell the story much differently. they say (candidate last) did not play the singular role in the asbestos episode that he portrays in the best-selling memoir 'dreams from my father: a story of race and inheritance.' credit for pushing officials to deal with the cancer-causing substance, according to interviews and news accounts from that period, also goes to a well-known preexisting group at altgeld gardens and to a local newspaper called the chicago reporter. (candidate last) does not mention either one in his book." [los angeles times, 2/19/07] </p><p><b><i>chicago tribune:</i> (candidate last)'s assertion that nobody had indications rezko was engaging in wrongdoing 'strains credulity.'</b> "...(candidate last) has been too self-exculpatory. his assertion in network tv interviews last week that nobody had indications rezko was engaging in wrongdoing strains credulity: tribune stories linked rezko to questionable fundraising for gov. rod blagojevich in 2004 -- more than a year before the adjacent home and property purchases by the (candidate last)s and the rezkos." [chicago tribune editorial, 1/27/08] </p><p><b>(candidate last) was forced to revise his assertion that lobbyists 'won't work in my white house.'</b> "white house hopeful sen. (candidate full) (d-ill.) was forced to revise a critical stump line of his on saturday -- a flat declaration that lobbyists 'won't work in my white house' after it turned out his own written plan says they could, with some restrictions... after being challenged on the accuracy of what he has been saying -- in contrast to his written pledge -- at a news conference saturday in waterloo, (candidate last) immediately softened what had been his hard line in his next stump speech." [chicago sun-times, 12/16/07] </p><p><b><i>factcheck.org</i>: 'selective, embellished and out-of-context quotes from newspapers pump up (candidate last)'s health plan.'</b> "(candidate last)'s ad touting his health care plan quotes phrases from newspaper articles and an editorial, but makes them sound more laudatory and authoritative than they actually are. it attributes to the washington post a line saying (candidate last)'s plan would save families about $2,500. but the post was citing the estimate of the (candidate last) campaign and didn't analyze the purported savings independently. it claims that "experts" say (candidate last)'s plan is "the best." "experts" turn out to be editorial writers at the iowa city press-citizen – who, for all their talents, aren't actual experts in the field. it quotes yet another newspaper saying (candidate last)'s plan "guarantees coverage for all americans," neglecting to mention that, as the article makes clear, it's only (candidate last)'s and (candidate last)' plans that would require coverage for everyone, while (candidate last)'s would allow individuals to buy in if they wanted to." [factcheck.org, 1/3/08] </p><p><b>sen. (candidate last) said 'i passed a law that put illinois on a path to universal coverage,' but (candidate last) health care legislation merely set up a task force.</b> "as a state senator, i brought (PARTY NAME)s and (PARTY NAME) together to pass legislation insuring 20,000 more children. and 65,000 more adults received health care...and i passed a law that put illinois on a path to universal coverage." the state journal-register reported in 2004 that "the [illinois state] senate squeaked out a controversial bill along party lines wednesday to create a task force to study health-care reform in illinois. [...] in its original form, the bill required the state to offer universal health care by 2007. that put a 'cloud' over the legislation, said sen. dale righter, r-mattoon. under the latest version, the 29-member task force would hold at least five public hearings next year."

(candidate full), d-ill., seemed to exaggerate the legislative progress he has made on disclosure of "bundlers," those individuals who aggregate their influence with the candidate they support by collecting $2,300 checks from a wide network of wealthy friends and associates. when former alaska sen. mike gravel alleged that (candidate last) had 134 bundlers, (candidate last) responded by telling gravel that the reason he knows how many bundlers he has raising money for him is "because i helped push through a law this past session to disclose that." earlier this year, (candidate last) sponsored an amendment [sic] in the senate requiring lobbyists to disclose the candidates for whom they bundle. (candidate last)'s amendment would not, however, require candidates to release the names of their bundlers. what's more, although (candidate last)'s amendment was agreed to in the senate by unanimous consent, the measure never became law as (candidate last) seemed to suggest. gravel and the rest of the public know how many bundlers (candidate last) has not because of a 'law' that the illinois (PARTY NAME) has 'pushed through' but because (candidate last) voluntarily discloses that information."
