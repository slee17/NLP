<span class="displaytext">for several days, simple questions have been posed to the the (candidate full) campaign: <p>has anyone associated with their campaign met with canadian officials? has anyone associated with their campaign offered private assurances to canadian officials downplaying (candidate last)'s anti-nafta rhetoric? </p><p>in response, the (candidate last) campaign has offered several carefully parsed non-denials. </p><p>but this evening new information has come to light: senator (candidate last)'s top economic advisor admitted to meeting with the canadian consul general but has refused to deny that he discussed nafta in this meeting. </p><p>this raises a host of additional questions: now that it is clear that this meeting occurred, what was discussed? did austan goolsbee or any (candidate last) official downplay senator (candidate last)'s anti-nafta rhetoric to canadian officials? why have they have been trying to give the impression that no conversation ever occurred? </p><p>voters deserve more than empty rhetoric and senator (candidate last) and his campaign should finally come clean and answer these questions. </p><p><i>abc news report, 2/29/08:</i> </p><p>on thursday, goolsbee told abc's jennifer parker that canada's consul general in chicago contacted him "at one point to say 'hello' because their office is around the corner." </p><p>goolsbee refused, however, to deny whether he downplayed (candidate last)'s anti-nafta rhetoric.</p></span>
