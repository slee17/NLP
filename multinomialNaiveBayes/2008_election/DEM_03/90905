<span class="displaytext">"over this past week, there has been a lot of discussion and back and forth - much of which i know does not reflect what is in our hearts. <p>"and at this moment, i believe we must seek common ground. </p><p>"our party and our nation is bigger than this. our party has been on the front line of every civil rights movement, women's rights movement, workers' rights movement, and other movements for justice in america. </p><p>"we differ on a lot of things. and it is critical to have the right kind of discussion on where we stand. but when it comes to civil rights and our commitment to diversity, when it comes to our heroes - president john f. kennedy and dr. king - senator (candidate last) and i are on the same side. </p><p>"and in that spirit, let's come together, because i want more than anything else to ensure that our family stays together on the front lines of the struggle to expand rights for all americans."</p></span>
