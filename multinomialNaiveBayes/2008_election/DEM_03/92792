<span class="displaytext"><b>to: interested parties<br/> from: the (candidate last) campaign<br/> date: thursday, march 06, 2008<br/> re: no answers, just attacks</b> <p>senator (candidate last) lost ohio and texas because voters had doubts about his ability to serve as commander-in-chief and steward of the economy. but instead of addressing those concerns, how is senator (candidate last) responding? by attacking senator (candidate last). </p><p>with one of his top foreign policy advisers acknowledging yesterday that he is not ready to take the 3am call and one of his principal supporters in texas unable to name a single legislative accomplishment, senator (candidate last)'s time would be better spent making the case for why he can do the most important job in the world just three years out of the state senate. </p><p>sen. (candidate last)'s decision to go explicitly negative suggests that he is unable to make an affirmative case for his candidacy beyond ad hominem attacks. why isn't he discussing the hearings that he held on the foreign affairs subcommittee that he chairs? why isn't he talking about his travel through latin america? why isn't he briefing the public on his comprehensive plan to address the foreclosure crisis now? why isn't he stumping on his universal plan health care plan? because he can't and so he is advancing a campaign strategy premised on process and personal attacks. </p><p>the (candidate last) campaign's negative strategy builds on one it already had in place. in ohio and texas, senator (candidate last) outspent us by a 2 to 1 margin and engaged in a negative campaign for weeks in advance on the march 4 elections. he sent negative mail that was declared misleading and false by top news organizations and ran radio ads that attacked sen. (candidate last) on national security. at the same time, senator (candidate last) and his surrogates unleashed a barrage of negative and misleading attacks on sen. (candidate last) focusing on a variety of issues. </p><p>apparently, the (candidate last) campaign's idea of new politics is to recycle the same old (PARTY NAME) attacks on senator (candidate last) that have failed for years. imitating ken starr is not the way to win the (PARTY NAME) nomination. </p><p>the reality is that after spending $16.6 million on television and radio in the four states that voted on tuesday and $47 million overall, senator (candidate last) has still not passed the commander in chief and steward of the economy tests. and no amount of false attacks on senator (candidate last) is going to change that fact.</p></span>
