<span class="displaytext">to: interested parties<br/> from: mark penn, chief strategist <br/> date: thursday, march 20, 2008<br/> re: polling memo - the shift to hillary <p>there are some pretty big changes happening out there with the voters. (candidate full) recently declared himself the frontrunner in the race, although there are 10 contests remaining and mi and fl have not yet been decided. but a look at the polls shows that sen. (candidate last)'s lead nationally with (PARTY NAME) has been evaporating. the gallup daily tracking poll shows hillary leading sen. (candidate last) among (PARTY NAME) by 7 points, and the latest zogby/reuters poll has sen. (candidate last)'s lead down from 14 points last month to just 3 points now. this suggests a strong swing in momentum in the race to hillary since the texas and ohio primaries earlier this month. </p><p>the more that the voters learn about (candidate full), the more his ability to beat (candidate full) is declining compared to hillary. for a long time we have explained that poll numbers for a candidate who has not yet been vetted or tested are not firm numbers, and we are beginning to see that clearly. just a month ago, the (candidate last) campaign claimed that the polls showed (candidate full) doing better than hillary against sen. (candidate last). now such numbers are a lot harder to find. </p><p>in the latest usa today/gallup poll, hillary leads (candidate full) by 5 points (hillary 51 / (candidate last) 46) while sen. (candidate last) is only 2 points ahead of sen. (candidate last) ((candidate last) 49 / (candidate last) 47). this is a reversal from february, when sen. (candidate last) led hillary by 4 points. the latest cnn poll also shows that hillary leads sen. (candidate last) by a bigger margin than (candidate full). </p><p>in several key states, hillary is a stronger general election candidate than (candidate full) against (candidate full). for example, the latest survey usa poll has hillary leading sen. (candidate last) by 6 points in ohio while sen. (candidate last) trails sen. (candidate last) by 7 points. in kentucky, hillary's margin against sen. (candidate last) is 26 points better than (candidate full)'s. in missouri, sen. (candidate last) lags (candidate full) by 14 points while hillary comes within 2 points of sen. (candidate last). in florida, the latest ppp poll shows (candidate full) losing to (candidate full) by 11 points while hillary comes within 4 points of sen. (candidate last). last week's university of central arkansas poll showed hillary leading sen. sen. (candidate last) by 15 points in that state while sen. (candidate last) trails sen. (candidate last) by 16 points. and the latest rasmussen poll showed hillary leading sen. (candidate last) by 11 points in new jersey while sen. (candidate last) trails sen. (candidate last) by 2 points. </p><p>moreover, 24 percent of florida (PARTY NAME) say that if florida's delegates are not counted at the (PARTY NAME) convention in august, they are less likely to vote for a (PARTY NAME) in november, according to the latest st. petersburg times/bay news 9/miami herald poll. since florida is the single largest and most important swing state in the country and nearly 1.8 million florida (PARTY NAME) voted in the january primary, (PARTY NAME) must find a solution to allow florida's delegates to count if we are to have any hope of winning in november. </p><p>and in the crucial state of pennsylvania - the next (PARTY NAME) primary battleground and the biggest state which has not yet voted - the latest quinnipiac poll shows hillary doubling her (PARTY NAME) primary lead over (candidate full) from 6 points to 12 points. in pennsylvania, hillary improved among men, maintained her 24 point advantage among women, and improved among younger, older, more educated and less educated voters. she leads in every region across the state (ne, se, nw, sw, central, alleghany) with the exception of philadelphia. </p><p>ultimately, this (PARTY NAME) nominating process is meant to select the candidate who will: a) be the best president - the best commander-in-chief, steward of the economy, and exercise leadership; b) defeat (candidate full); and c) promote and defend core (PARTY NAME) principles such as universal health care. on all three fronts, hillary is the best choice for the (PARTY NAME) party. </p><p>hillary is the runaway leader on most qualified to be commander-in-chief. in the ohio exit poll, 60 percent of (PARTY NAME) primary voters said hillary was most qualified to be commander-in-chief, compared with 37 percent for (candidate full). in texas, she led by 16 points, and in most other states, she led by 10 points or more. she also won among those who said the economy was the most important issue - by 12 points in ohio, for example. and in the latest cnn poll, more voters say hillary would do a good job on the economy than (candidate full) or (candidate full). finally, in the latest usa today/gallup poll, hillary leads (candidate full) on strong and decisive leadership, managing the government effectively and having a clear plan for solving the country's problems.</p></span>
