<span class="displaytext">on earth day, we embrace our responsibility to each other and to future generations: every one of us, from the president in the white house to children in schools to ceos in boardrooms can help protect the environment and save our planet. <p>that is the spirit that gives this day meaning. that is the call to citizenship that will help us solve the climate crisis and meet other threats to our environment. and that is why it is so important we elect a new president who will boldly and immediately set a new course. </p><p>when i am president, our nation will lead the world to tackle the climate crisis - and lead the global economy in new clean energy industries. i have a plan to promote energy independence, address global warming, and transform our economy by creating five million new jobs. i will reduce global warming emissions by 80% below 1990 levels and establish a market-based cap-and-trade system to efficiently allocate pollution permits. i will cut foreign oil imports by two-thirds from 2030 projected levels, more than 10 million barrels per day; raise fuel efficiency standards to 55 miles per gallon by 2030; invest $150 billion in renewable, alternative energy; and ensure that 25% of our electricity comes from renewable sources by 2025. i will end the bush administration's assault on environmental protections and standards. and climate researchers in our government will no longer be silenced - their results manipulated - to adhere to a radical ideological agenda. it will be a new day. </p><p>but meeting these big environmental challenges will take both new leadership and renewed citizenship. i encourage all americans to find ways in their own lives to reduce their carbon footprints, to conserve energy, to protect greenspace in their communities, and to take other steps to safeguard our planet. we are all stewards of this earth, and we must all be part of the solution.</p></span>
