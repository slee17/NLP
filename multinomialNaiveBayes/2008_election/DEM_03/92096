"through their service and sacrifice, our veterans defended our country, our freedom, and our values. we could never adequately repay the debt that is owed. but what we can do and must do is ensure that veterans receive the benefits they have earned through their service and continue strengthening the country they fought for and love." </p><p>(candidate full) built on her long history of fighting for our veterans and announced new policies to ensure our country fulfills its obligations to those who have served and sacrificed for the nation. she announced that, as president, she will enact a gi bill of rights for the 21st century that will offer service members, veterans and their families with expanded education, housing and entrepreneurial benefits. in addition, as president, hillary will ensure that all of the 1.8 million uninsured veterans in this country has access to quality, affordable health care and will establish a pilot program on homelessness prevention for veterans. the program will provide subsidies, eviction prevention, and one-time assistance for veterans who fall behind on their rent. </p><p>"i'm standing with (candidate full) today, because she has stood with us," said major general eaton, who served in the army for 33 years, most recently serving in iraq. "no one in this race has the strength and expertise on military and veterans' issues that (candidate full) possesses." </p><p>the campaign also released a new minute video on its web site of veterans and family members of veterans who support (candidate last). "i served my country for almost nine years now, and i plan on doing so, you know, for as long as i can in the future," said rose forrest, an iraq war veteran. "that being said like any good soldier, you know, i train for war, but i pray for peace. and i think (candidate full) will bring us peace." the video can be viewed at: http://www.(candidate full).com/video/66.aspx <http:> . <p>when (candidate full) is president, she will end the war in iraq. her three-step plan would bring our troops home, work to bring stability to the region, and replace military force with a new diplomatic initiative to engage countries around the world in securing iraq's future. hillary has also been fighting in the senate to force a course change.

"i know (candidate full) and her understanding of diplomacy and force will ensure that our wonderful military remains the best in the world and when deployed will be assigned winnable missions, will be adequately resourced, and will be supported with all elements of our national power." </p><p>(candidate last) has also been an outspoken critic of the current administration's handling of the conditions at walter reed army medical center. in march, (candidate last) visited the center to see the conditions firsthand. during her visit, she visited wounded soldiers at the hospital and met with new york service members to hear their concerns. she then called on the secretary of veterans affairs to commission a comprehensive review of the quality of care being received by wounded veterans, both past and present, at va facilities around the country. she also asked for a review of the va's process of evaluating wounded veterans for disability benefits. </p><p>"i strongly support senator (candidate last) because i believe that she is the right person for the job - at the right time. she understands the military, both in its internal dynamics and as an instrument of policy," said lt. general ballard. "i believe that she will bring the right degree of concern for our all of service members and their families. her determination, fairness and toughness as the next commander in chief will enable her to make the hard but necessary decisions that will positively impact not only our military but our national security." </p><p>"i'm honored to have the support of these distinguished veterans," said (candidate last). "with their help, we will finally bring an end to the war in iraq, rebuild america's role in the world, and deliver on the promises made to the men and women who have served our country." </p><p>(candidate last) has a long history of working on issues important to active duty and retired military personnel. as first lady, she helped call attention to gulf war syndrome. as a member of the senate armed services committee, hillary has championed legislation to improve the lives of our veterans and their families. she worked to provide access to tricare for national guard and reserve members. she authored the heroes at home act that will begin to help service members struggling with post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. she worked with others in the senate to pass legislation to increase the military survivor benefit from $12,000 to $100,000. she represents bases such as fort drum, home of the 10th mountain division, west point, watervliet arsenal, fort hamilton, the rome air force research laboratory, niagara falls air reserve station and four other air national guard bases. she is also the only senator to serve on the joint forces command transformation advisory group. </p><p><b>new national co-chairs are:</b> general wesley clark, ret. <br/> four star general<br/> supreme allied commander, nato</p><p>lt. general joseph ballard, ret. <br/> three star general<br/> chief of engineers and commander, u.s. army corps of engineers</p><p>lt. general robert gard, ret.<br/> three star general<br/> president emeritus of the monterey institute for international studies.</p><p>lt. general donald kerrick, ret.<br/> three star general<br/> deputy national security advisor<br/> assistant to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff </p><p>lt. general frederick vollrath, ret.<br/> three star general<br/> deputy chief of staff for personnel, headquarters department of the army</p><p>major general roger blunt, ret. <br/> two star general<br/> u.s. army corps of engineers<br/> last command: 97th army reserve command (arcom), ft. meade chairman, president, &amp;
