<span class="displaytext">washington, dc -- "we are deeply saddened by the loss of congresswoman juanita millender-mcdonald. in the congress, she brought her life experiences, her grit, her grace, and her sense of duty to the job, and her constituents and our country are better for it. as a former teacher, she never lost sight of our duty to the next generation and taught all of us a thing or two, whether she was standing against the genocide in darfur or standing up for fair and free elections here at home. our thoughts and prayers are with her family during this difficult time."</span>
