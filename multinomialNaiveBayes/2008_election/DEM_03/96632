<span class="displaytext">*in a letter and memo sent to superdelegates today, hillary lays out the case for why she is the strongest candidate to put together a winning coalition and beat (candidate full) in the fall. <p>*hillary has earned more votes than anyone in the history of the (PARTY NAME) primaries, and she will lead in the popular vote with more than 17 million ballots cast when the primaries conclude on june 3rd. </p><p>*not only is hillary the top vote-getter, poll after poll shows she fares better against sen. (candidate last) in large swing states than sen. (candidate last). she is the only candidate winning in the battlegrounds of ohio and florida. </p><p>*hillary's candidacy has attracted a broad coalition of new voters. in fact, the highest increases in turnout have come among her core supporters - millions of new women, latinos and people over 45 voted in the primaries for the first time. </p><p>*in the coming days, superdelegates will have a clear choice: who is ready to serve as president on day one and who is best able to beat (candidate full) in november? when you look at her wins in the important swing states and her strength against sen. (candidate last) in head-to-head matchups, there's no question that hillary is the strongest candidate.</p></span>
