<span class="displaytext">denver, co - the denver post's editorial board endorsed (candidate full) for the (PARTY NAME) nomination today. the endorsement is extremely rare for the denver post, which typically refrains from endorsing in presidential primaries. <p>excerpts from the endorsement </p><p><i>"(candidate last)'s plan for universal health insurance is far more comprehensive than the hit-and-miss proposal put forward by (candidate last)." </i> </p><p><i>..."as important as that symbolism is, (PARTY NAME) have an even greater responsibility: to pick the most qualified candidate to lead america at a time when it faces great challenges at home and abroad. measured by her long record in public life and her thoughtful proposals to deal with america's most pressing problems, the post believes that candidate is new york sen. hillary rodham (candidate last)."</i> </p><p><i>"(candidate last)'s long record in public life shows her well prepared to deal with two of america's greatest challenges: ending the war in iraq and solving our health insurance crisis.</i> </p><p><i>"(candidate last) is well prepared to oversee a careful disengagement from iraq and to serve as the military and diplomatic leader of the free world. she served with distinction on the senate armed services committee, where she mastered the intricate details of national and international security.

(candidate full), whose eloquence and vision lured young voters and independents into (PARTY NAME) contests in record numbers in iowa and south carolina. (candidate last) has similarly shown a powerful appeal to women and latinos in new hampshire, nevada and florida. </p><p>the difference between the two candidates is that (candidate last)'s eloquence is not matched by his achievements in the mere three years he has spent in the u.s. senate. in contrast, (candidate last)'s long record in public life shows her well prepared to deal with two of america's greatest challenges: ending the war in iraq and solving our health insurance crisis. </p><p>the two (PARTY NAME) candidates share some commonalities. both seek to end the war in iraq, recast the american economy to better serve poor and middle-class citizens, begin dealing with climate change, rein in the runaway budget deficits of the bush administration and restore america's standing in the world. but while they share a common vision of america's future, (candidate last) is more likely to forge that vision into real progress. </p><p>america must seek a swift end to the war in iraq. but our precipitous withdrawal in 1975 from an unpopular war in vietnam led to executions and mass imprisonments of vietnamese who had fought on our side of the war and a desperate exodus of refugee "boat people." we must end this war honorably, without betraying the brave iraqi voters who proudly waved their ink-stained fingers to show their faith in america's promises to the tender mercies of al-qaeda torturers. </p><p>(candidate last) is well prepared to oversee a careful disengagement from iraq and to serve as the military and diplomatic leader of the free world. she served with distinction on the senate armed services committee, where she mastered the intricate details of national and international security. (candidate last) has no comparable experience on military or diplomatic issues. </p><p>if iraq is america's most pressing foreign issue, health care is our most serious domestic problem. (candidate last) led the ill-starred 1993 fight for health care reform. she learned from her past mistakes and was a key architect of the successful children's health insurance program. now, (candidate last)'s plan for universal health insurance is far more comprehensive than the hit-and-miss proposal put forward by (candidate last). </p><p>(candidate last)'s health insurance plan was inspired by the one pioneered in massachusetts by former gov. (candidate full) - whose success in that effort is one reason the post has endorsed him for the (PARTY NAME) presidential nomination. </p><p>(candidate last) has criticized (candidate last)'s health care plan because it requires citizens to buy coverage while subsidizing low-income workers. but (candidate last)'s voluntary plan simply won't work, any more than a voluntary social security plan could work. by allowing seemingly healthy people to avoid buying insurance, (candidate last) would simply saddle the taxpayers with the costs of their care if and when they are stricken by such catastrophic illnesses as cancer. </p><p>we genuinely admire both these candidates and confess we'd like to see them team up in denver in a (candidate last)/(candidate last) ticket. marrying (candidate full)'s proven record of performance with (candidate full)'s uplifting vision would truly make history for the (PARTY NAME) party - and possibly for america as a whole.</p></span>
