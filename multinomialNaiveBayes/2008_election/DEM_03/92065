<span class="displaytext">sixteen years after their first trip in support of then governor bill (candidate last), the arkansas travelers are heading back to new hampshire to campaign and rally in support of (candidate full)'s campaign for president in the final days before the new hampshire primary. on january 2nd and 3rd, 74 members of the all volunteer group will head to new hampshire and spread out across the state, urging new hampshire primary voters to support (candidate full) in the presidential primary. "sixteen years ago we never expected to be back on the road before the 2008 primary, but we're just as excited and enthusiastic as we were in 1991 and 1992," said sheila bronfman, who organizes the arkansas travelers from little rock. "the travelers cannot wait to tell new hampshire voters about our friend hillary and why her experience and strength have prepared her to lead our country." the new hampshire trip marks the second venture the arkansas travelers have made into an early-voting state on behalf of hillary. in october, nearly three dozen volunteers headed to iowa to campaign for the former arkansas first lady. the travelers covered ground between council bluffs and des moines during that trip. "the travelers are eager and energized to hit the road in new hampshire," said bronfman. "over the next seven days, we'll be knocking on doors and talking to new hampshire voters from sun-up to sundown. from working to end the war in iraq to fighting for universal health care, hillary is committed to giving this country the new direction it desperately needs. and we won't stop until we make sure every new hampshire voter knows this."</span>
