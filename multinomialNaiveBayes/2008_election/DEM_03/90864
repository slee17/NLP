<span class="displaytext">as we begin gay pride month, i join the lgbt community in celebrating an historic year in which our country continues to make progress towards the fair and equal treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender americans. still, we have so much work to do. i look forward to working with the lgbt community to make sure that all americans in committed relationships have equal benefits and that nothing stands in the way of loving couples who want to adopt children in need. we need to expand our federal hate crimes legislation and pass a fully-inclusive employment non-discrimination act. and finally, we need to put an end to the failed policy of don't ask, don't tell. courage, honor, patriotism and sacrifice - the traits that define our men and women in uniform - have nothing to do with sexual orientation. <p>to each and every lgbt american, i say this: you have done so much to help this country understand your lives by simply being open and honest about who you are and living your lives with dignity. thank you for your courage. it is time that we recognize your hard work. i know that this country is ready for changes in the law that reflect the evolution in our hearts. you deserve a government that treats you with the respect you deserve. </p><p>america deserves a president who appeals to the best in each of us, not the worst; a president who values and respects all americans and treats all americans equally no matter who they are or who they love. that is truly the promise of america.</p></span>
