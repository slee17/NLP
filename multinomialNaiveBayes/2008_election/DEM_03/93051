<span class="displaytext">with his announcement that his administration will now seek nearly $200 billion in supplemental funding for overseas military operations, president bush is once again asking congress and the american people to foot the bill for his failed leadership. the bush administration's escalation in iraq has not led to political reconciliation and our troops still remain in the middle of a civil war. as i have said before, i cannot and will not support funding legislation that does not begin to bring our troops home. our men and women in uniform are serving bravely and honorably â€“ funding a failing strategy does not serve our troops or our nation. we should begin the withdrawal of u.s. troops safely and responsibly. unless the administration changes course in iraq, i will vote against this supplemental request.</span>
