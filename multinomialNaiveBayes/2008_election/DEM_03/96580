<span class="displaytext">today, president bush delivered yet another address on iraq - but we've heard enough speeches that are long on promises, short on facts. <p>and the fact is, there will probably be more troops in iraq after the surge than before the surge. iraq has barely moved toward political reconciliation, meeting only a few of the benchmarks set out by the bush administration at the start of the surge. and violence has once again spiked in baghdad and basra. </p><p>on tuesday, i asked general petraeus when he came before the senate armed services committee what conditions would mean we should change course, given that the surge has failed to achieve political reconciliation. he did not answer. </p><p>yesterday i called on president bush to answer the question general petraeus did not. but the president refuses to face reality. </p><p>i want to commend president bush for agreeing to cut the length of deployments from 15 to 12 months. but it is deeply unfortunate that the president only made this change when the strain he placed on our forces required it. </p><p>now, once again president bush is asking americans for time and patience - but the american people are saying he's had enough of both. </p><p>our troops have done all that's been asked of them and more. it's time for the president to answer the question being asked of him: in the wake of the failed surge, what is the endgame in iraq? </p><p>as president, i will do what this president has failed to do: recognize reality and end the war responsibly.</p></span>
