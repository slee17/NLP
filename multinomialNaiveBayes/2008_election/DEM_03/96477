<span class="displaytext">"nevadans have the opportunity to play a special role in the nominating process on saturday, and we are thrilled with the energy and support we are seeing across the state. it is clear that nevadans are excited about participating in this process. while we were not involved in this lawsuit, and have always said that we would play by the rules that we're given, it has always been our hope that every nevadan should have equal access and opportunity to participate in the caucus. make no mistake --the current system that inhibits some shift workers from being able to participate, while allowing others to do so, would seem to benefit other campaigns. more importantly it is unfair. we also are concerned with recent news reports about voter intimidation tactics that would further discourage some nevadans from participating on saturday. our strategy remains the same â€” we want as many people as possible to participate in the caucus, and we are going to reach out to as many nevadans as possible in an effort to do as well as possible on saturday. the (candidate last) campaign has been clear in its belief that whoever wins the culinary union endorsement will win nevada. we will leave it up to the people of nevada to make that decision."</span>
