(candidate full). the combination of her proven track record and positive vision for america make her our choice in the (PARTY NAME) primary. </p><p>sen. (candidate last) earned our admiration as the first lady and respect as a u.s. senator from new york. today she's an engaging personality able to unite people behind a common cause regardless of their political affiliations. she hit the senate floor on the run and she can do the same thing in the white house. </p><p>she is sincere and passionate about restoring fiscal responsibility, providing health care to all americans, protecting the environment, keeping the tax burden off the middle class and earning the faith and trust of the american people. </p><p>but no president can do it alone. she must break recent tradition, cast cronyism aside and fill her cabinet with the best people, not only the best (PARTY NAME), but the best (PARTY NAME)s as well.. we're confident she will do that. her list of favorite presidents - washington, adams, jefferson, lincoln, both roosevelts, truman, george h.w. bush and reagan - demonstrates how she thinks. as expected, bill (candidate last) was also included on the aforementioned list. </p><p>after all it was during his administration - eight years of peace and prosperity - that hillary was able to observe, learn and contribute, all at the same time. and though she possesses traits similar to the former president, a great communicator chief among them - the voters of new york state have overwhelmingly validated her abilities - twice. </p><p>sen. (candidate last) told us she doesn't want our vote just because she's a "woman." she wants our vote because she's the "best." on the (PARTY NAME) side we agree that she is.</p></span>
