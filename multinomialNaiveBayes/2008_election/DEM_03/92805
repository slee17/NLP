<span class="displaytext"><b>to: interested parties<br/> from: the (candidate last) campaign<br/> date: april 23, 2008<br/> re: the tide is turning</b> <p>the voters in pennsylvania have spoken. america is listening. and the tide is turning. </p><p>by providing fresh evidence that hillary is the candidate best positioned to beat (candidate full) in the fall, the pennsylvania primary is a turning point in the nominating contest. </p><p>despite making an unprecedented financial investment in his pennsylvania campaign, including millions on negative ads in the closing days of the race, sen. (candidate last) again failed to win a state that will be vital to a (PARTY NAME) victory in november and spurred new questions about his ability to beat (candidate full). no candidate has ever had more resources or enjoyed the kind of momentum that sen. (candidate last) had in pennsylvania. </p><p>with concerns about the economy paramount, voters decided that sen. (candidate last) was the candidate they trusted most to deal with job loss, the housing crisis and health care. </p><p>and with both candidates under the microscope at the same time for the first time, hillary took more than a few punches and came out stronger while sen. (candidate last) emerged weaker as voters learned more about him. the exit polls clearly show that sen. (candidate last) gained strength in the final days when the campaign was most engaged. </p><p>the reason for the (candidate last) comeback is clear: voters want a candidate who will stand strong for them and work to create a better future. </p><p>strong on economy: pennsylvania turned on which candidate made the better case for fixing the economy. exit polls show voters viewed hillary more favorably on the economy - her leadership resonated across the heartland of pennsylvania. those who want change in the economy voted overwhelmingly for hillary. </p><p>a decisive victory: according to exit polls, hillary won voters most concerned about the economy by 16 points (58-42) and union households by 18 points (59-41). she won those with incomes between 100k and 150k by 20 points (60-40); white women by 32 points (66-34) and catholics by 38 points (69-31). she won those who decided on the last day (59-41), the last three days (58-42) and the last week (54-46). </p><p>sen. (candidate last) played to win &amp; lost: sen. (candidate last) played to win pennsylvania outright, outspending the (candidate last) camp by a 3 to 1 margin while sharply attacking sen. (candidate last) on the stump and in television, radio, and direct mail pieces. he understood what was at stake for him in pennsylvania, had six full weeks to make his case, went for a knockout at the end and came up short. sen. (candidate last)'s failure to do well raises questions about his ability to win the large, swing states that (PARTY NAME) need to win in november. </p><p>hrc will win in november: (PARTY NAME) must win the large swing states to beat (candidate full) in the fall, but sen. (candidate last) has struggled in states like ohio, florida, and pennsylvania. in addition, hillary's voters form the coalition needed for (PARTY NAME) success in the fall battleground states: women, hispanics, older voters, working class voters and catholics. sen. (candidate last) is stronger than a typical (PARTY NAME) normally is among these groups while sen. (candidate last) has proven weaker among them. hillary is also most likely to hold traditionally (PARTY NAME) states and poised to expand the electoral map in the southwest while also flipping a few traditionally gop states like arkansas. </p><p>our victory has re-energized our campaign &amp; our grassroots: sen. (candidate last) may have outspent us 3 to 1 in pennsylvania, but hillary's strong supporters kept her in it. as news of sen. (candidate last)'s victory spread, we received more donations at www.(candidate full).com and more new online contributors than after our wins in ohio and texas. in fact, this was our best night ever for online fundraising.</p></span>
