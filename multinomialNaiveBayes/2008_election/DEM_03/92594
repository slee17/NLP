"everyday families struggle without health care coverage and i'm supporting (candidate full) because she has the experience to create the change we need in our health care system." </p><p>"i'm frustrated when i see families who have lost health insurance and delay treatment until it becomes a medical emergency. every person deserves healthcare," said pediatrician julie thomas of cedar rapids. "without (candidate full), universal healthcare would not even be an issue and i support her because she is the only candidate with the strength and experience to finish the battle." </p><p>"i am honored to have the support of these dedicated health care professionals," (candidate last) said. "my plan covers all americans and improves health care by lowering costs and improving quality. it's a plan that works for america's families and america's businesses, while preserving consumer choices." </p><p>hillary's american health choices plan fundamentally reforms the nation's health care system by lowering costs, improving quality, and covering all americans. building on her prior proposals to rein in costs and to insist on value and quality, yesterday senator (candidate last) announced her plan which will secure, simplify and ensure choice in health coverage for every american. </p><p>hillary's plan covers every american - finally addressing the needs of the 47 million uninsured and the tens of millions of workers with coverage who fear they could be one pink slip away from losing their health coverage - with no overall increase in health spending or taxes. for those with health insurance, the plan builds on the current system to give businesses and their employees greater choice of health plans - including keeping the one they have - while lowering cost and improving quality. </p><p>(candidate full) has been fighting for children and families for 35 years. in arkansas, she helped bring health care to thousands of rural families. as first lady, she fought for health care reform, and has the scars to show for it. but hillary never gave up. she fought for and helped pass the state children's health insurance program (schip) which provides health insurance to more than 6 million kids a year nationwide. and as senator, she fought to expand schip and get 9/11 first responders, veterans and military families the health care they need and deserve. </p><p>iowa health care professionals leadership council: </p><p></p><li> martha craft-rosenberg of coralville, johnson county;
