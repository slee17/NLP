<span class="displaytext">sen. (candidate last) is attacking (candidate full) about health care in a television advertisement with claims that have been widely discredited by experts. <p>1. the (candidate last) ad claims that hillary's "plan forces everyone to buy insurance even if you can't afford it." health policy expert ken thorpe reviewed this claim and found it to be false. under hillary's plan, everyone will be able to afford coverage. </p><p>"ken thorpe, a health-policy expert at emory university who has advised all three major (PARTY NAME), said he ran cost estimates for the (candidate last) plan at the (candidate last) campaign's request, and found there should be enough money to make insurance affordable for all." [wall street journal, 12/5/07] </p><p>2. the advertisement also claims that that hillary's plan would make people who fail to enroll "pay a penalty." sen. (candidate last)'s own plan would fine parents who fail to enroll their children and he has said he will consider imposing penalties on people who don't enroll. </p><p>hillary would consider a range of ideas, including automatic enrollment, to ensure everyone is covered. sen. (candidate last)'s plan, would, experts agree, leave 15 million people out. </p><p>3. the ad also claims that sen. (candidate last)'s plan reduces costs more than hillary's plan. there is no citation for this claim because it is false. hillary's plan has more aggressive cost cutting measures and has more generous subsides. because sen. (candidate last)'s plan leaves 15 million people out, it would drive costs up, because everyone would have to subsidize emergency care for the uninsured.</p></span>
