"whether it is school lunches for low-income kids, more funding for education initiatives or making college more affordable for students, hillary's work and dedication is impacting my community and the students i teach." </p><p>"as first lady, hillary became the leading advocate of universal health care," said katie beckett a disability rights activist of cedar rapids. "when the political will wasn't there for her to pass universal health care in the 90's, she didn't give up the fight. instead she played an instrumental part in the creation of the state children's health insurance program, which today insures more than five million kids. hillary has the experience to create the change we need in america." </p><p>following is a list of the 105 women making up the initial statewide women's leadership council: (titles for identification purposes only) </p><ul><p></p><li>jacky adams of red oaks, montgomery county;
