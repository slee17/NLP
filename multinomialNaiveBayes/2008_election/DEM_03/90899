<span class="displaytext">the bush administration has spent most of the last 8 years censoring scientists, pretending that global warming is a problem that doesn't exist, and standing in the way of solutions. now that the administration has been forced to acknowledge global warming as a problem, they have put forward a proposal that looks like it was written by dick cheney's energy task force. the president's proposal is not to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but to actually allow them to continue to grow until 2025. global warming is an urgent problem that demands a bold response that will actually reduce emissions, not allow them to continue to increase for nearly 20 more years. i have proposed a comprehensive, bold plan to reduce global warming. my plan will reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80% below 1990 levels by 2050 through a market-based, cap-and-trade system in order to avoid the most dire impacts of global warming. i will also act immediately to develop a post-kyoto treaty with a goal of having one in place by the end of 2009. america needs a president who will lead on day one, not one whose leadership is a day late and a dollar short.</span>
