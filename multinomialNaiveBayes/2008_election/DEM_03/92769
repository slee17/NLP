<span class="displaytext"><b>rep. frank will serve as economic adviser</b> <p>the (candidate last) campaign announced the endorsement of massachusetts congressman barney frank and named him as an economic advisor to the campaign. </p><p>"i have from the beginning of this campaign believed that (candidate full) was the candidate best qualified to serve as president," rep. frank said. "i am convinced that once elected, the qualities she will bring to the job - commitment, intellect, and political skills - will make her an extremely effective leader in our effort to reverse the badly flawed course on which george bush and past (PARTY NAME) congresses have set this country. </p><p>"i am particularly pleased by her commitment to reverse the economic policies that have created a situation in which as the country progresses economically, only a small number of americans benefit. her understanding of the need to implement policies that provide fairness for middle and working class people is very important. she has shown an ability to fight for progressive values in a way that is capable of appealing to the majority of our fellow citizens, and i believe that she is both politically and substantively the candidate best qualified to be our nominee. </p><p>"as chair of the house financial services committee with major responsibilities for various parts of our economy, i particularly look forward to working with her and members of her administration in once again demonstrating that economic growth and a concern for economic fairness in fact are reinforcing values, and not, as the current administration believes, in competition with each other. </p><p>"in addition, based on my work with her on issues involving discrimination, i am convinced that (candidate full) is the candidate best equipped to pass laws that will treat all americans with dignity, fairness and equality no matter who they are or who they love." </p><p>"i'm honored to have the support of one of the sharpest minds in congress," (candidate last) said. "barney has devoted his life to championing economic fairness and civil rights, and expanding opportunity for all americans. i'm delighted he'll take a leadership role in our campaign."</p></span>
