<span class="displaytext"><i>in response to a report this morning in the washington post revealing that senator (candidate last)'s leadership pac has given the majority of its campaign contributions to officials and committees in the early nominating states, the (candidate last) campaign released the following statement:</i> <p>this morning, we learned that senator (candidate last) has been using his leadership pac to give political contributions to officials in the early primary states. in fact, 68 percent of contributions from his pac have gone to those in states that are scheduled to hold nominating contests on february 5th or earlier. </p><p>it is our understanding that a candidate's campaign is barred from using the candidate's leadership pac to benefit his or her campaign which is why we shut down hillpac when senator (candidate last) announced her run for the white house. </p><p>on the campaign trail, senator (candidate last) is outspoken about his desire to reform the campaign finance system so it was surprising to learn that he has been using his pac in a manner that appears to be inconsistent with the prevailing election laws. considering how often senator (candidate last) talks about his efforts to be transparent, we presume he will answer the following questions regarding the behavior of his pac: </p><p>1. who decided what contributions would be made by hopefund? </p><p>2. did any presidential campaign staff, consultants or advisors participate in any discussions about hopefund contributions? who? </p><p>3. did the decision-makers know who was endorsing the presidential campaign? if so, how did they find this out? </p><p>4. who told hopefund which iowa and new hampshire candidates and committees should get contributions? </p><p>5. are there any overlapping employees, consultants and advisors between hopefund and the presidential campaign? </p><p>6. the washington post article suggests that hopefund was dormant earlier in the year. who made the decision to start making contributions again and on what basis was that decision made?</p></span>
