<span class="displaytext"><i>in a press availability this morning, (candidate full) made the following remarks regarding a memo that has surfaced confirming communication between sen. (candidate last)'s top economic advisor, austan goolsbee and the canadian embassy about nafta.</i> <p>i think that after days of denial, the (candidate last) campaign was confronted with a memo of a meeting - it was my understanding - in which there was a discussion of nafta. and it raises questions about senator (candidate last) coming to ohio and giving speeches about nafta and having his chief economic advisor tell the canadian government that it was just political rhetoric. </p><p>i don't think people should come to ohio and tell the people of ohio one thing and then have your campaign tell a foreign government something else behind closed doors. that's the kind of difference between talk and action and that i've been pointing out in this campaign. i think the questions should be directed at senator (candidate last). </p><p>i don't think people should come to ohio and you both give speeches that are very critical of nafta and you send out misleading and false information about my positions regarding nafta and then we find out that your chief economic advisor has gone to a foreign government and basically done the old wink-wink, don't pay any attention this is just political rhetoric.</p></span>
