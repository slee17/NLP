<span class="displaytext">hugo chavez's order yesterday to send ten battalions to the colombian border is unwarranted and dangerous. the colombian state has every right to defend itself against drug trafficking terrorist organizations that have kidnapped innocent civilians, including american citizens. by praising and supporting the revolutionary armed forces of colombia, chavez is openly siding with terrorists that threaten colombian democracy and the peace and security of the region. rather than criticizing colombia's actions in combating terrorist groups in the border regions, venezuela and ecuador should work with their neighbor to ensure that their territories no longer serve as safe havens for terrorist groups. after reviewing this situation, i am hopeful that the government of ecuador will determine that its interests lie in closer cooperation with colombia on this issue. hugo chavez must call a halt to this provocative action. as president, i will work with our partners in the region and the oas to support democracy, promote an end to conflict, and to press chavez to change course.</span>
