<span class="displaytext">massachusetts attorney general and automatic delegate martha coakley announced her support for (candidate full) today. the massachusetts state (PARTY NAME) committee elected her one of its automatic delegates to the (PARTY NAME) national convention on may 10. attorney general coakley's statement follows below: <p>"i am determined to see a successful (PARTY NAME) campaign for president in november. i believe that the (PARTY NAME) primary has demonstrated to the american people that there are two able and hard working candidates, either of whom can win the presidency. either will be a huge improvement for america over what the (PARTY NAME)s have offered for the last eight years and what they offer now for the next four. i will support whoever is the nominee of the party. </p><p>"however, as one of two unpledged delegates elected by the massachusetts state committee, i have determined to cast my vote for (candidate full). running for office under any circumstances is arduous and stressful; it is at times exhilarating and at times exhausting. it tests the issues, the families and supporters, and the very core of the candidate. running for president of the united states is all of that many times over. </p><p>"regardless of the outcome of the primary, mrs. (candidate last)'s energy, stamina, and resolve have changed the course of history for women seeking office, including the presidency, and i dare say, have changed the course of history of presidential politics in the united states. it is for these reasons that i will vote for (candidate full) in august at the nominating convention."</p></span>
