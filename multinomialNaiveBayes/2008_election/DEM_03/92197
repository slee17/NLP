<span class="displaytext"><strong>washington post's e.j. dionne - hillary plan shows she 'has the character to be president':</strong> "there's another message: she knows a lot more than she used to about voters and how to persuade them -- and about herself. leaders who can laugh at their own failures are usually more trustworthy than those who can't... it could turn out that (candidate last)'s strongest argument is that someone who is aware of her own shortcomings, laughs about them and works at them has the character to be president."

(candidate last), in setting out her route to universal coverage, adds some promising policy twists. the most interesting would limit the tax deductibility of employer-sponsored health plans for the wealthiest americans, a sensible step toward fixing one of the most expensive and counterproductive parts of the tax code."
