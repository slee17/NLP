<span class="displaytext"><b>to: interested parties<br/> from: the (candidate last) campaign<br/> date: march 21, 2008<br/> re: (candidate last) campaign: just words</b> <p>at this point, it's no secret that the (candidate last) campaign is in political hot water given the news stories of the last few weeks and is desperate to change the subject. </p><p>the ground is shifting away from them and their response? </p><p>first, disenfranchise voters - prevent new votes in florida and michigan. stop voting in pennsylvania, north carolina, oregon, west virginia, puerto rico, kentucky, south dakota, montana, west virginia and indiana. </p><p>second, peddle photos of president (candidate last) shaking hands with reverend wright less than 48 hours after calling for a high-minded conversation on race. well, president (candidate last) took tens of thousands of photos during his eight years as president. stop the presses. </p><p>third, accuse our campaign of having something to do with senator (candidate last)'s passport file being breached, a reckless charge that has zero merit. </p><p>fourth, continue attacks on senator (candidate last)'s character in an effort to implement what the chicago tribune called a full assault on her ethics. </p><p>fifth, stonewall the press: no tax returns, no state records, no answers about the inconsistencies in the rezko story. </p><p>so it's not a pretty sight - it's all part of a pattern of just words. </p><p>senator (candidate last) talks about voter participation while actively disenfranchising millions. </p><p>he calls for high minded debates while practicing lowdown politics. </p><p>he promises a different kind of campaign while attacking hillary's character. </p><p>he promises transparency while hiding basic info and stonewalling the press. </p><p>it's no wonder that americans are coming to see that for all of his lofty rhetoric, senator (candidate last)'s candidacy is really just words. </p><p>it's no surprise that americans are expressing serious doubts about his ability to answer the 3am call. </p><p>it's no wonder that top journalists are calling the (candidate last) campaign desperate, saying that it's amateur hour in chicago.</p></span>
