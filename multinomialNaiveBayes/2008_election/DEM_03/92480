<span class="displaytext">dear friend: <p>i am writing to tell you about my friend, (candidate full), and why i am standing with her in her campaign for the presidency. i know the kind of president (candidate full) will be because i know the person she is. </p><p>i am inspired by her courage and her honesty. she is a reliable and trustworthy person. she is someone i not only admire but one for whom i have profound affection. </p><p>hillary does not waver in standing up for those who need a champion. she has always been a passionate protector of families. as a child, she was taught that all god's children are equal, and as a mother, she understood that her child wasn't safe unless all children were safe. as i wrote about hillary recently in a praise song: "she is the prayer of every woman, and every man who longs for fair play, healthy families, good schools and a balanced economy." </p><p>it may be easy to view (candidate full) through the narrow lens of those who would write her off or grind her down. hillary sees us as we are, black and brown and white and yellow and pink and relishes our differences knowing that fundamentally we are all more alike than we are unalike. she is able to look through complexion and see community. </p><p>she has endured great scrutiny, and still she dares greatly. (candidate full) will not give up on you, and all she asks is that you do not give up on her. she is a long-distance runner. i am honored to say i am with her for the long run. </p><p>i am supporting (candidate full) because i know that she will make the most positive difference in people's lives and she will help our country become what it can be. whether you are her supporter, leaning towards her, undecided, or supporting someone else, i believe (candidate full) will represent you â€“ she will be a president for all americans. it is no small thing that along the way we will make history together. </p><p>vote for (candidate full) and show your support at www.(candidate full).com. i know she will make us proud.</p></span>
