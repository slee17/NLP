<span class="displaytext">with last night's victories in ohio and texas, one thing is clear: the <strong>momentum</strong> has swung back to (candidate full). voters in both states agreed that (candidate full) would be the best <strong>commander-in-chief</strong> and the strongest <strong>steward of our economy</strong>. in fact, according to last night's polls, those who decided who to vote for in the last three days overwhelmingly favored hillary [<em>cnn exit polls, 3/4/08</em>]. <strong>it's time for a second look.</strong> <p></p><ol> <p></p><li><strong>ohio is the barometer</strong>: hillary was successful in ohio, the state that for the last quarter century has picked our president. as everyone knows: as ohio goes, so goes our country. historically, it's one of the bellwether states and it decided the last election. and the demographics of the upcoming contests in pennsylvania, west virginia, indiana and kentucky closely mirror those in ohio. hillary looks strong in all four states. <ul> <li><strong>in recent years, every president has won two of the three following states: ohio, pennsylvania and florida</strong>. hillary has already won two of those and, according to all polls, is leading in the third – pennsylvania. </li> </ul> <p></p></li> <li><strong>this race is extremely close and more than 5 million (PARTY NAME) are likely to vote.</strong> after 28 million votes have been counted, the popular vote contest in the (PARTY NAME) primary is within one-tenth of one percent. applying the same level of turnout to the remaining contests, there are still more than <strong>5 million (PARTY NAME) voters</strong> – 17 percent of the total – who are likely to participate in this contested primary race. after 41 primaries and caucuses, the <strong>delegate count is within roughly 2 percent</strong>. <p></p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="msonormaltable" style="border-collapse: collapse"><tbody> <tr> <td style="border-right: windowtext 1pt solid;

(candidate last) has won ten: utah, idaho, nebraska, north dakota, alabama, alaska, kansas, south carolina, georgia, and louisiana. john kerry lost each of these states by fifteen points or more. </li> <li>the last time a (PARTY NAME) nominee won utah, idaho, nebraska, north dakota, kansas, and alaska in the general election was 1964. </li> <li>even if (candidate last) is "transcendent," as his campaign has argued, the historic electoral trends and the current political environment suggest that <strong>translating those primary wins into november success will be close to impossible. </strong></li> <li>in short: hillary is better positioned to <strong>carry the battle ground states</strong> that (PARTY NAME) need to win in november and (candidate last)'s victories in deep red states do not . </li> </ul> <p></p></li> <li>hillary is the only (PARTY NAME) with the <strong>strength, leadership, and experience to defeat (candidate full). senator (candidate last) is seen as the best prepared to be commander-in-chief.</strong> <ul> <li>nationally, 57% say (candidate full) is <strong>best prepared</strong> to be president, 39% (candidate last) [<em>cbs/ nyt, february 24</em>] </li> <li>(candidate full) is seen as best able to <strong>take on the (PARTY NAME)s</strong> on their own turf – national security and terrorism. she is seen as a strong and decisive leader (a seven point advantage over (candidate last) nationally). </li> <li>hillary is seen as the one who can <strong>get the job done</strong> – leading (candidate last) nationally by 13 points [<em>usa today/ gallup, 2/24</em>]. </li> <li>hillary is seen as the candidate to <strong>solve the country's problems</strong>, leading (candidate last) by 10 points [<em>usa today/ gallup, 2/24</em>]. </li> </ul> <p></p></li> <li><strong>(candidate full) will diminish any perceived advantage (candidate last) has with independents</strong>. as has been widely discussed, one of (candidate full)'s key constituents is independents. and against (candidate last), (candidate last) will be framed by the (PARTY NAME)s as too liberal (he was ranked by the <em>national journal</em> as the most liberal senator); untested on national security; and vulnerable on issues that would make him unelectable in november. these issues may be surmountable in a (PARTY NAME) primary but will be an achilles heel with independents in a general election. <p></p></li> <li><strong>the (candidate last) roadmap</strong>: (candidate last) has already foreshadowed his campaign's construct against (candidate last): his vulnerability is experience and judgment on national security. <ul> <li><em>(candidate last)</em>: (candidate last)'s 'meet, talk and hope approach' is 'dangerously naã¯ve in international diplomacy.' "meet, talk, and hope may be a sound approach in a state legislature, but it <em>is dangerously naive in international diplomacy where the oppressed look to america for hope</em> and adversaries wish us ill." [(candidate last), nyt's the caucus, 2/22/08] </li> <li><em>(candidate last)</em>: (candidate last) is an 'inexperienced candidate who once suggested bombing our ally, pakistan, and suggested sitting down without preconditions or clear purpose with enemies who support terrorists.' "each event poses a challenge and an opportunity. will the next president have the experience -- the judgment, experience informs and the strength of purpose to respond to each of these developments in ways that strengthen our security and advance the global progress of our ideals? or will we risk the confused leadership of an inexperienced candidate who once suggested bombing our ally, pakistan, and suggested sitting down without preconditions or clear purpose with enemies who support terrorists and are intent on destabilizing the world by acquiring nuclear weapons? i think you know the answer to that question." [<em>post-wisconsin primary victory speech</em>, 2/19/08] </li> </ul> <p></p></li> <li><strong>steward of the economy</strong>. (candidate full) leads both (candidate full) and (candidate full) on the economy and health care. in the latest la times/bloomberg poll (1/22), hillary leads (candidate last) 52/28 on health care and 43/34 on the economy. <ul> <li>hillary leads (candidate full) on health care by 21 points nationally [<em>usa today/gallup</em>, 2/24]. </li> </ul> <p></p></li> <li><strong>florida</strong>. there is an additional reality that must be considered – the <strong>1.75 million</strong> <strong>voters in florida</strong> whose votes will not be represented at the (PARTY NAME) convention. how we handle this swing state will affect our party's potential of carrying it in november ((PARTY NAME) lost florida in 2004). this is a state where the playing field was level – all of the candidates had their names on the ballot and none campaigned in the state. <p></p></li> <li><strong>michigan</strong>. nearly 600,000 (PARTY NAME) voted in <strong>michigan</strong>, but right now their votes are not being counted. (PARTY NAME) barely carried michigan in 2004 (by only 3% -- 51 to 48). if our party refuses to let them participate in the convention, we will provide a political opportunity for the (PARTY NAME)s to win both florida and michigan. recognizing their importance to (PARTY NAME) success in november, hillary has called for the delegates of both states to be seated at the convention. <p></p></li> <li><strong>hillary has the money to compete</strong>. in february, the (candidate last) campaign raised approximately $35 million – averaging more than a million dollars a day. this deep level of support gives hillary the resources she needs to compete between now and the convention. </li> </ol></span>
