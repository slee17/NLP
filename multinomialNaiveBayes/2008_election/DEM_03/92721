(candidate full) and (candidate full) have spoken eloquently on most of the issues, as have (candidate full), (candidate full) and (candidate full). all have their passionate supporters, and for good reason. but this newspaper has come to the conclusion that the candidate with the best ideas, as well as the imagination, know-how and bearing to carry them out, is (candidate full). </p><p>she has the best health-insurance proposal of all the candidates, and there are several good proposals to choose from. she has significant international experience, considerably more than some of her rivals. face-to-face, she is as personable, passionate and persuasive as any american political figure in recent memory, qualities that should come in handy in both domestic and international forums. </p><p>yes, we know. the doubts about (candidate full)'s candidacy are widely discussed, often in terms of whether other voters would accept a woman, or accept this woman, as president. we are aware of the reservations some people have about aspects of the bill (candidate last) years. but we find those arguments wanting, or at the very least misplaced. many of today's hillary doubters, regardless of party, would surely be impressed during the coming national campaign, just as many new hampshire voters have been won over during the arduous primary campaign now coming to an end. choosing a candidate on the (PARTY NAME) ballot is a tough call this year. in the end, we are confident in our recommendation of (candidate full).</p></span>
