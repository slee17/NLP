<span class="displaytext">as firm opponents of the iraq war, we believe there is no higher priority for the next president of the united states than ending this war, and we believe there is no one better prepared and more committed to bringing this war to a responsible conclusion than (candidate full). the best way to honor the sacrifices of our brave young men and women in uniform is to bring them home. <p>we support (candidate full) because she is the candidate with the stature, strength, and experience needed to end this war as quickly and responsibly as possible. </p><p>hillary has put forward the most comprehensive plan for bringing our troops home, with troop withdrawals beginning within 60 days of taking office. she bravely pressed the pentagon to begin planning for the withdrawal of our troops from iraq. and she has introduced legislation to bar the bush administration from unilaterally negotiating a long-term security agreement with the iraqi government and thereby tying the hands of the next administration. </p><p>hillary's commitment to ending this war is matched by her experience. her knowledge of the armed forces, her service on the senate armed services committee, and her extraordinary efforts on behalf of our veterans have earned her the respect of our men and women in uniform. </p><p>we are proud to support her because we know that she is the candidate ready to bring our troops home. </p><p>del. donna christian-christensen (d-vi)<br/> rep. yvette clarke (d-ny) <br/> rep. maurice hinchey (d-ny) <br/> rep. sheila jackson-lee (d-tx)<br/> rep. carolyn maloney (d-ny)<br/> rep. jim mcgovern (d-ma) <br/> rep. michael mcnulty (d-ny) <br/> rep. jerrold nadler (d-ny)<br/> rep. richard neal (d-ma)<br/> rep. frank pallone (d-nj) <br/> rep. lucille roybal-allard (d-ca) <br/> rep. jose serrano (d-ny) <br/> rep. hilda solis (d-ca) <br/> rep. edolphus towns (d-ny)<br/> rep. stephanie tubbs jones (d-oh) <br/> rep. maxine waters (d-ca)<br/> rep. diane watson (d-ca)<br/> rep. lynn woolsey (d-ca)</p></span>
