<span class="displaytext">senator (candidate full) today issued the following statement on a new congressional energy bill that increases biofuel production: <p>"i am pleased that congressional leaders are working towards agreement on an energy bill that would increase the production of homegrown biofuels. increasing biofuels production to 60 billion gallons by 2030 is a key component of my comprehensive plan to reduce dependence on foreign oil, take action on global warming, and revitalize rural economies. i was proud to support a senate energy bill earlier this year that would move us towards that biofuels goal, and i will be working with congressional colleagues to pass a final version of that bill this year."</p></span>
