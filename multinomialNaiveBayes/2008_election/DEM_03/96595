(candidate last)'s oregon campaign is holding events to highlight his record on environmental issues. however, these events will leave out his vote on the most important environmental issue (candidate last) faced during his time in the senate - his support of dick cheney's 2005 energy bill. </p><p>critically for oregon, the energy bill sen. (candidate last) supported also cut states out of the loop in deciding where liquefied natural gas (lgn) lines and terminals will be located. </p><p>(candidate full) opposed the bill, which was written in secret with the oil industry. she has a plan to eliminate oil industry tax breaks, and would require oil companies to contribute to a $50 billion strategic energy fund to jumpstart research and investment in clean energy technologies. </p><p>hillary announced a series of initiatives in oregon earlier this month to address the twin challenges of global warming and our reliance on foreign oil. her plan will work with states like oregon that are leading the green revolution to help unleash a wave of private sector innovation and create at least 5 million new green collar jobs over the next decade. </p><p>to read more about hillary's plan to combat global warming and move america toward a clean energy future, visit http://www.(candidate full).com/issues/energy</p></span>
