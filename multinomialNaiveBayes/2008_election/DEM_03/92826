<span class="displaytext">earlier today, sen. (candidate last) attacked hillary on iraq by invoking sen. rockefeller and incorrectly saying that the wva senator opposed the 2002 iraq vote. the truth is that sen. rockefeller voted for the war resolution - not against it as sen. (candidate last) suggested to the people of ohio. this seems to be an (candidate last) campaign talking point since its top strategist also claimed that sen. rockefeller voted against the war resolution when he was on national television this morning. <p>"sen. (candidate last) is so desperate to divert attention from his limited national security experience that he's not just misleading voters about sen. (candidate last), he's also misleading voters about his own supporters. that is not change you can believe in." -- (candidate last) spokesperson phil singer </p><p>facthub</p></span>
