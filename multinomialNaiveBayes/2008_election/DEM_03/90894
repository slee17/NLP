<span class="displaytext">senator (candidate full) made the following comments in a speech before the take back america conference in washington this morning. <p>"you know, later today, apparently, the president will veto a bill passed by congress to support stem cell research. </p><p>"now, this is research that...holds such promise for devastating diseases. yesterday, i met with a group of children suffering from juvenile diabetes. i co-chair the alzheimer's caucus in the senate. i've worked on helping to boost funding for research to look for cures and a way to prevent so many devastating diseases. and we know that stem cell research holds the key to our understanding more about what we can do. so let me be very clear: when i am president, i will lift the ban on stem cell research. </p><p>"this is just one example of how the president puts ideology before science, politics before the needs of our families, just one more example of how out of touch with reality he and his party have become. and it's just one more example as to why we're going to send them packing in january 2009, and return progressive leadership to the white house."</p></span>
