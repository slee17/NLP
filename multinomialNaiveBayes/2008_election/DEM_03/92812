<span class="displaytext">to: interested parties<br/> from: (candidate last) campaign<br/> date: tuesday, may 13, 2008<br/> re: why west virginia matters<br/> <p>with a record turnout expected in today's primary, west virginia (PARTY NAME) will make clear who they believe is the strongest candidate to take on sen. (candidate last) in the fall. </p><p>the mountain state is used to picking winners. every nominee has carried the state's primary since 1976, and no (PARTY NAME) has won the white house without winning west virginia since 1916. </p><p>(PARTY NAME) carried west virginia in 1992 and 1996, but lost the state - and the white house - in 2000 and 2004. hillary has predicted victory against sen. (candidate last) in west virginia based on the strength of her economic message. </p><p>given the attempts by our opponent and some in the media to declare this race over, any significant increase in voter turnout, coupled with a decisive (candidate last) victory, would send a strong message that (PARTY NAME) remain excited and energized by hillary's candidacy. </p><p>in the face of grim poll numbers, the (candidate last) campaign has attempted to dismiss today's outcome despite the fact that sen. (candidate last) has outspent us on advertising, has more staff in the state, and more than double the number of offices. </p><p>he has also benefited from the support of the most high-profile endorsers in west virginia - sen. jay rockefeller and congressman nick rahall. by every measure, the (candidate last) campaign has waged an aggressive campaign in the mountain state. </p><p>despite being the so-called "presumptive nominee" and benefiting from these advantages, sen. (candidate last) has been unable to close a significant gap in the polls. </p><p>sen. (candidate last) has already won ohio, pennsylvania, florida and michigan. with a win in west virginia, sen. (candidate last) will have once again proven her greater ability to win in the key swing states.</p></span>
