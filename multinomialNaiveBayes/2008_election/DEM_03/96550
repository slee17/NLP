<span class="displaytext"><b>lee feinstein, campaign national security director, released the following statement </b> <p><i>senator (candidate last) has thus far failed to answer key questions about his qualifications to meet the commander-in-chief test. the following are questions that senator (candidate last) should address:</i> </p><p>will you stand by your definitive commitment to removing all combat brigades from iraq within 16 months, or will you, as your former advisor said, not rely on "some plan" you "crafted as a presidential candidate or as a us senator?" </p><p>do you regret that you have never held any substantive hearings on afghanistan or any other subject, since you became chairman of the subcommittee on european affairs in january 2007? </p><p>do you agree with general mcpeak that you are more qualified to be commander in chief because you don't "go on television and have crying fits?" are you prepared to remove general mcpeak from your campaign for what is viewed by many as a sexist comment? </p><p>are you still willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of an (candidate last) administration, in washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of iran, syria, venezuela, cuba and north korea? are there any circumstances in which you would not conduct such meetings? </p><p>as voters evaluate you as a potential commander-in-chief, do you think it's legitimate for people to be concerned that you have traveled to only one nato country, on a brief stopover trip in 2005, and have never traveled to latin america? </p><p>earlier in the campaign you were asked how you would respond to a terrorist attack on two cities in the united states. you talked about the need for an effective emergency response but were initially unclear about the need for a military response. what do you think that says about your readiness to be commander-in-chief? </p><p>you publicly broadcast your willingness to attack pakistan unilaterally, a statement which caused unrest in that country. recognizing that we need to combat terrorism wherever it exists, do you wish you would have made your comments in a way that didn't cause unrest?</p></span>
