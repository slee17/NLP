[howard fineman, msnbc, 4/26/07] </p><p>msnbc's chris matthews -- 'mrs. (candidate last) did very well': "i thought mrs. (candidate last) did very well, the senator did very well tonight. i thought that she is the front runner in all the polls and she has to maintain a certain presence.. she avoided criticizing anyone else, she talked about the president mostly." [chris matthews, msnbc, 4/26/07] </p><p>ajc's cynthia tucker -- '(candidate last) looked presidential..she's in a very good position to win this race: "i also have to say as others have already said, that senator (candidate last) looked very presidential. i don't think that she put aside forever the question of whether a woman can be commander-in-chief. i think that question will come up for her again and again and again. but if she comports herself as well throughout the rest of this very long campaign as she did this evening, she's in very a good position to win this race and that's something i didn't think six months ago."

[amy holmes, cnn, 4/26/07] </p><p>terry holt -- hillary 'demonstrated she's the real deal': "i think tonight she demonstrated that she's the real deal. a lot of people said that she's too rigid, that she's too bound by the discipline of her campaign. but that came through tonight with authority, with conviction. she hit it out of the park when she talked about how she would respond to two city attack by terrorists. she was the most definitive and the strongest in that regard. i think that she did all that she could do tonight in this field to distinguish herself as the frontrunner" [terry holt, cnn, 4/26/07]</p></span>
