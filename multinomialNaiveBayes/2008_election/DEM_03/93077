<span class="displaytext">i am very concerned about the current situation in lebanon. hezbollah-allied militias, using weapons supplied by iran and syria, have seized control of west beirut and are demanding that prime minister fouad siniora resign and hand over power to a military government. this is both an illegal challenge to a (PARTY NAME)ally-elected government and an issue of regional stability with international consequences. <p>the united states must actively support the sovereignty of the lebanese government and the independence of lebanon. </p><p>the united states needs to engage in vigorous diplomacy with its regional allies to support the lebanese government. outside parties, such as iran and syria, must immediately stop their interference in lebanon and allow the election of the president to proceed.</p></span>
