<span class="displaytext">"the news today of the largest beef recall in our nation's history is yet another troubling reminder that we have done too little to protect our food supply. this incident also reveals a danger to our children, since the hallmark company is the second largest supplier to the u.s. school lunch program. i believe that american families should not have to worry about the safety of the food on their dinner tables or in their children's school lunches. that is why i have long been calling for common-sense - and long-overdue - food safety reforms, building on my work in the senate. as president, i will fully fund our food safety system so that our inspectors have the resources and manpower they need to do their jobs. i will create a single food safety agency to replace the patchwork of regulation we have now. i will implement an effective recall system so that potentially tainted food immediately comes off grocery store shelves and families receive instant notification. i will strictly enforce safety rules and impose stiff criminal and civil penalties on violators. and i will crack down on the slaughter of sick or injured cows, a practice which poses health risks to families and children. now more than ever, america needs a president who will deliver concrete reforms that fill the gaps in our food safety system."</span>
