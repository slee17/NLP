<span class="displaytext"><b>new (candidate last) tv ad in south dakota falsely claims his plan covers everyone, but independent experts disagree, campaign also claimed in conference call today that its plan cuts costs more than (candidate last)'s, which is also false</b> <p>in response to sen. (candidate last)'s tv ad claiming his health care plan covers everyone – and his campaign's subsequent claim on a conference call with reporters that his plan cuts costs more than (candidate full)'s does – the (candidate last) campaign released the following response: </p><p><i>"it's unfortunate that senator (candidate last) didn't have the courage to produce a universal health care plan and instead wrote a plan that leaves 15 million americans without coverage. that is unacceptable and senator (candidate last) should explain why he chose to leave so many people uninsured," (candidate last) campaign spokesman phil singer said. "when it comes to cutting costs, senator (candidate last)'s plan is just as aggressive, if not more so. the real difference is that her plan covers every american and senator (candidate last)'s leaves 15 million without insurance."</i> </p><p><b>on covering every american:</b> while sen. (candidate last) claims that his health care plan covers every american like sen (candidate last)'s does, experts really believe his plan, which lacks an individual mandate, would actually leave 15 million people uninsured. for example: </p><p><b>concord monitor: 'gruber estimated that 15 million people would remain uninsured under (candidate last)'s plan.'</b> "jonathan gruber, a health economist at massachusetts institute of technology who worked on the massachusetts plan, said a mandate means "the difference between universal or near-universal coverage. (candidate last) would have a large expansion, better than anything the (PARTY NAME)s have, but not universal coverage," gruber said. "you can't get it without a mandate; it's just not possible." gruber estimated that 15 million people would remain uninsured under (candidate last)'s plan." [concord monitor, 12/26/07] </p><p><b>len nichols, jonathan gruber and mark pauly: 'even with other cost saving measures and a child mandate, we think that it is very likely that a least 15 million american would remain uninsured.</b>' "recent estimates suggest that a plan with uniform generous subsidies but without a mandate would cover no more than one-half of the uninsured in the u.s. even with other cost-saving measures and a child mandate, we think that it is very likely that at least 15 million americans would remain uninsured." [new america foundation policy brief, 12/06/07] </p><p><b>jonathan holohan of the urban institute: '(candidate last) would still leave about 22 million, 23 million, but he has a mandate for children, about 9 million uninsured kids, so assuming you get most of them, you get pretty close to 15 million.'</b> [new republic, 12/03/07] </p><p><b>wall street journal: 'mrs. (candidate last) charges that mr. (candidate last)'s plan would leave 15 million people without insurance. outside experts agree that number is in the ballpark.'</b> [wall street journal, 12/04/07] </p><p><b>washington post: 'the (candidate last) plan could leave a third of those currently uninsured lacking coverage.'</b> [washington post, 6/9/07] </p><p><b>on cutting costs:</b> today on a conference call, the (candidate last) campaign claimed that his plan does more to cut costs than any other plan. that's not true either. both plans take the following steps to cut costs: </p><p>1. require chronic care disease management in federal programs </p><p>2. support care management teams and medical homes to improve care coordination </p><p>3. require providers to collect and publicly report measures of cost and quality </p><p>4. develop and disseminate best practices and value-based purchasing in federal programs </p><p>5. medical malpractice reform </p><p>6. invest in comparative effectiveness research </p><p>7. promote adoption of health information technology </p><p>8. administrative savings through group purchasing </p><p>9. allow reimportation of prescription drugs </p><p>10. remove barriers to generic competition </p><p>11. allow secretary to negotiate rx drug prices in medicare </p><p>12. eliminate medicare overpayments in managed care </p><p>13. promote prevention and invest in public health and safety-net providers </p><p>14. eliminate health disparities </p><p>15. invest in health care workforce non-physician providers </p><p>16. federal reinsurance for catastrophic health expenses </p><p>moreover, hillary's plan takes several additional steps to reduce costs not found in sen. (candidate last)'s plan: </p><p>1. hard limits on excess profit and administrative costs in insurance company premiums </p><p>2. prohibit payment for medical errors in all federal programs </p><p>3. create a pathway for biogeneric competition </p><p>4. provide more oversight of drug advertising, marketing excesses and inappropriate financial relationships with providers. </p><p>5. require e-prescribing in federal programs. </p><p>in adidtion, hillary's plan contains more subsidies than sen. (candidate last)'s plan -- </p><p>"outside experts note that the (candidate last) and (candidate last) plans propose spending about the same amount of money, while mr. (candidate last) uses some of his to pay for the reinsurance plan -- an initiative that could cost tens of billions of dollars. that should help lower premiums across the board, but it means there would be less available for direct subsidies."
