<span class="displaytext"><b>to: interested parties<br/> from: the (candidate last) campaign<br/> date: may 3, 2008<br/> re: why did the (candidate last) campaign predict victory in indiana? does that prediction still stand?</b> <p>three months ago the (candidate last) campaign produced a spreadsheet that, with one exception, has accurately predicted the winners in each of the upcoming primaries and caucuses. </p><p>tellingly, that spreadsheet predicted an (candidate last) victory in indiana by 7 points, as well as an (candidate last) victory in north carolina. </p><p>does the (candidate last) campaign still stand by that prediction? if not, why not, and what has happened? </p><p>it is easy to see why the (candidate last) campaign predicted victory in indiana. senator (candidate last) has won each of the primaries in the states that border illinois - iowa, wisconsin, and missouri, and 25% of hoosiers get their television from illinois stations - a huge advantage for senator (candidate last). indiana's primary is open, and senator (candidate last) has tended to do better in those contests. </p><p>the (candidate last) campaign has also dramatically outspent senator (candidate last) in indiana by more than $2.4 million -- $5.6m - $3.2m and has even gone up on broadcast television in the very expensive chicago media market. </p><p>despite senator (candidate last)'s advantages and his prediction of victory, we have worked hard in indiana to do as well as we can and anticipate a close finish. </p><p>in north carolina, tuesday's other contest, senator (candidate last) enjoyed a lead of over 20 points in public polls throughout this year and outspent us there on tv by $1.3m -- $4.9 - $3.5. senator (candidate last) has been working hard to narrow that 20 point gap. </p><p>the (candidate last) campaign is closing on the big challenges and questions facing american families - who is on your side and who is best able to fight for working and middle class people on day one in the white house?</p></span>
