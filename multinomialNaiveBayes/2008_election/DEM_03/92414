<span class="displaytext"><i>from the endorsement:</i> <p><i>"the times demand results. we believe as president she'll do what she's always done in her life: throw herself into the job and work hard. we believe hillary rodham (candidate last) can do great things for our country."</i> </p><p><b><i>[click here]</i> for the des moines register editorial</b> </p><p>full endorsement article: </p><p>a deep, talented field in the (PARTY NAME) caucus race offers both good and difficult choices. </p><p>no fewer than three candidates would, by their very identity, usher the nation to the doorstep of history. should the party offer the nation the chance to choose its first woman president? or its first black president? or its first latino president? </p><p>or should the party place its trust in two senators, (candidate full) or (candidate full), who have served their nation with distinction for more than 30 years each? or should it heed (candidate full)' clarion call to restore opportunity for all americans? </p><p>beyond their personal appeal, the candidates have outlined ambitious policy proposals on health care, education and rural policy. yet these proposals do little to help separate the field. their plans are similar, reflecting a growing consensus in the party about how to approach priority issues. </p><p>the choice, then, comes down to preparedness: who is best prepared to confront the enormous challenges the nation faces - from ending the iraq war to shoring up america's middle class to confronting global climate change? </p><p>the job requires a president who not only understands the changes needed to move the country forward but also possesses the discipline and skill to navigate the reality of the resistant washington power structure to get things done. </p><p>that candidate is new york sen. hillary rodham (candidate last). </p><p>from working for children's rights as a young lawyer, to meeting with leaders around the world as first lady, to emerging as an effective legislator in her service as a senator, every stage of her life has prepared her for the presidency. </p><p>that readiness to lead sets her apart from a constellation of possible stars in her party, particularly (candidate full), who also demonstrates the potential to be a fine president. when (candidate last) speaks before a crowd, he can be more inspirational than (candidate last). yet, with his relative inexperience, it's hard to feel as confident he could accomplish the daunting agenda that lies ahead. </p><p>(candidate last) was our pick for the 2004 nomination. but this is a different race, with different candidates. we too seldom saw the "positive, optimistic" campaign we found appealing in 2004. his harsh anti-corporate rhetoric would make it difficult to work with the business community to forge change. </p><p>unfortunately, for many americans, perceptions of (candidate last), now 60, remain stuck in a 1990s time warp. she's regarded as the one who fumbled health-care reform as a key policy adviser to her husband, president bill (candidate last), or as a driving force in the bitter standoff between the "(candidate last) machine" and the "vast right-wing conspiracy." </p><p>her record in the senate belies those images. today, she's widely praised for working across the aisle with sam brownback, lindsey graham and other (PARTY NAME)s. </p><p>determination to succeed and learning from her mistakes have been hallmarks of (candidate last)'s life. she grew up in park ridge, ill., graduated from wellesley college and earned a law degree from yale. as first lady in arkansas, she was both strategist and idealist, borne out by her commitment to children and families. as the nation's first lady, she in essence spent eight years as a diplomat, traveling to more than 80 countries and advocating for human rights. </p><p>in the senate, she has earned a reputation as a workhorse who does not seek the limelight. she honed knowledge of defense on the senate armed services committee. she has proactively served rural and urban new york and worked in the national interest, strengthening the children's health insurance program. (candidate last) is tough. tested by rough politics and personal trials, she's demonstrated strength, resolve and resilience. </p><p>can she inspire the nation? (candidate last) is still criticized in some quarters as being too guarded and calculating. (as president, when she makes a mistake, she should just say so.) </p><p>indeed, (candidate last), her chief rival, inspired our imaginations. but it was (candidate last) who inspired our confidence. each time we met, she impressed us with her knowledge and her competence. </p><p>the times demand results. we believe as president she'll do what she's always done in her life: throw herself into the job and work hard. we believe hillary rodham (candidate last) can do great things for our country.</p></span>
