<span class="displaytext"><b>to: interested parties<br/> from: howard wolfson, communications director<br/> date: monday, may 19, 2008<br/> re: mission accomplished? not so fast.</b> <p>senator (candidate last)'s plan to declare himself the (PARTY NAME) nominee tomorrow night in iowa (http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0508/10184.html) is a slap in the face to the millions of voters in the remaining primary states and to senator (candidate last)'s 17 million supporters. </p><p>there is no scenario under the rules of the (PARTY NAME) national committee by which senator (candidate last) will be able to claim the nomination tomorrow night. he will not have 2210 delegates, the number needed with florida and michigan included in the process, nor will he have 2025 delegates, the number needed to secure the nomination without florida and michigan. </p><p>premature victory laps and false declarations of victory are unwarranted. declaring mission accomplished does not make it so. </p><p>while senator (candidate last) inaccurately declares himself the nominee, senator (candidate last) will continue to work hard, campaigning for every vote in the upcoming states and making the case that she will be the best nominee to take on (candidate full) and be our next president.</p></span>
