(candidate last) is precisely correct when she says that people outside the region have a poor understanding of the troubling trends on our reservations. federal attention could help. that includes but is not limited to higher-ranking posts in the federal bureaucracy. </p><p>her truly universal health care plan would be welcomed by thousands of south dakotans. even on reservations, where health care is nominally universal already, such a plan would be welcome. the federal government would never be allowed to subject everyday americans to the kind of care native americans living on reservations routinely receive. ... </p><p>her resilience and determination never should be questioned. she has met or overcome every challenge or roadblock in her way, and there have been many. her determination to carry the nomination process through to its real conclusion has perhaps earned her a grudging respect from those who would never support her. </p><p>(candidate last) might not win this race. in fact, it's a long shot. but whatever some might say, the race is not over, and her name is on the ballot. win or lose, she's also the best (PARTY NAME) candidate for south dakota.</p></span>
