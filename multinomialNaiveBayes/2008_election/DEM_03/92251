<span class="displaytext"><i>campaign communications director howard wolfson issued the following statement on a conference call earlier this afternoon:</i> <p>"11,000 pages of the former first lady's schedules are now part of the public record and i believe that is approximately 11,000 more documents than the (candidate last) campaign has released up until this point relating to any part of his service especially as a state senator. </p><p>"when these documents were released and we had a chance to look at them online, we put out a statement about them and in that statement we called on senator (candidate last) again to release relevant documents and information from his tenure in the state senate relating to his schedule, to memos, to letters that he may have written to state agencies perhaps on behalf of mr. rezko or others. </p><p>"we've heard different answers from senator (candidate last) about this when asked about it. at one point he said he had documents, another point he said he did not have documents. apparently he left his office with nothing. </p><p>"but we have 11,000 documents in the public record as of today. senator (candidate last) has, as many of you know, been the subject of some 60 books. she is in many respects an open book. senator (candidate last) on the other hand has not been forthcoming with critical information about his tenure. from what i understand chicago newspapers have multiple foia requests into state agencies in illinois for basic information about senator (candidate last)'s correspondence with them. senator (candidate last) should do everything he can to release that information, to speed up that process in illinois. if he has the letters that he wrote and the responses that he received, which he may well, he should just go ahead and release them, he doesn't have to wait until the foia request has run its course. </p><p>"there is much that senator (candidate last) can do on the subject of disclosure if he chooses to make this an issue as he has. i think in many respects he has gotten a free ride on this but there is a voluminous amount of information that presumably should be available relating to his tenure in the state senate that he could release and make available at any time since he thinks that this is so important. i would again call on him to do so." </p><p><i>the campaign's statement on the release of hillary's (candidate last)'s schedules today by the national archives can be found here. </i></p></span>
