<span class="displaytext">"i am profoundly saddened and outraged by the assassination of benazir bhutto, a leader of tremendous political and personal courage. i came to know mrs. bhutto over many years, during her tenures as prime minister and during her years in exile. mrs. bhutto's concern for her country, and her family, propelled her to risk her life on behalf of the pakistani people. she returned to pakistan to fight for democracy despite threats and previous attempts on her life and now she has made the ultimate sacrifice. her death is a tragedy for her country and a terrible reminder of the work that remains to bring peace, stability, and hope to regions of the globe too often paralyzed by fear, hatred, and violence. <p>"let us pray that her legacy will be a brighter, more hopeful future for the people she loved and the country she served. my family and i extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the victims and their families and to the people of pakistan."</p></span>
