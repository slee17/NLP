<span class="displaytext">"having visited with culinary members in las vegas just two weeks ago, i was so pleased to learn today of the contract agreement reached between the union and harrah's entertainment. the fact that an agreement was reached that allows the company to grow and prosper, while effectively addressing the needs of the working men and women who support its operations, is proof that the collective bargaining process works." <p>"the tourism industry has made nevada one of the fastest growing states -- and economies -- in the nation. harrah's recognizes that its employees are the front line whose work keeps visitors coming back. the company has demonstrated its commitment to the workforce by offering good wages, opportunities for advancement, and excellent benefits." </p><p>"this agreement sets a great standard for others to follow, but we cannot celebrate until all of the 50,000 culinary members whose contracts have expired have equally responsible agreements in place. both the culinary and harrah's should be congratulated on today's agreement, and for their dedication to a fair bargaining process."</p></span>
