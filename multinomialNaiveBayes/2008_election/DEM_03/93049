<span class="displaytext">washington, dc - today's marches underscore the importance of comprehensive immigration reform. our immigration system is broken, and it is past time that we came together and implemented an effective policy which respects our immigrant heritage, the rule of law, and human dignity. that is what i am committed to achieving. <p>a comprehensive solution to our immigration crisis must include strengthening our borders, greater cooperation with our neighbors, strict but fair enforcement of our laws, federal assistance to state and local governments, strict penalties for those who exploit undocumented workers, and a path to earned legal status for those who are here, working hard, paying taxes, respecting the law, and willing to meet a high bar, including learning english. the solution must also protect the sanctity of families and repair the broken, unfair bureaucratic system that forces citizens and lawful immigrants to live apart from their spouses and children. </p><p>although many (PARTY NAME)s have tried to derail attempts at comprehensive immigration reform, i am committed to working with my colleagues to create an immigration system that respects our values. we must insist on comprehensive immigration reform that protects our homeland security and protects the dignity of millions of families who live here. there is a smart and effective, comprehensive solution to the impasse we face, and i will continue to pursue it.</p></span>
