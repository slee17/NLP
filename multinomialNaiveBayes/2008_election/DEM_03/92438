<span class="displaytext"><b>on equal pay day, nevadans urge congress to support (candidate last)-sponsored paycheck fairness act</b> <p>in recognition of equal pay day, nevadans for hillary today announced the first 81 nevada women to sign on in support of senator (candidate full)'s efforts to end pay discrimination -- symbolizing the 81 cents nevada women make for every dollar earned by a male counterpart. hundreds more are anticipated to send letters to the nevada congressional delegation urging support of (candidate last)'s paycheck fairness act. </p><p>the average american woman will need to work through april 24th, 2007 to earn the same amount a man doing the same job earned during 2006. because of the disparity, april 24 has been dubbed "equal pay day." </p><p>nationally, working women earn just 77 cents for every $1.00 earned by a male counterpart. women of color fare even worse, with african-american women earning only 67 cents and latinas only 56 cents for every $1.00 earned by white men." </p><p>"nevadans can count on (candidate full) to stand up for fair treatment in the workplace -- and her leadership on this legislation proves it once again," said frankie sue del papa, northern nevada chair, nevadans for hillary. "the response to this letter campaign shows that women are stepping up to support senator (candidate last) because of her experience and her advocacy on real issues that affect real people here in nevada." </p><p>the paycheck fairness act, re-introduced by senator (candidate last) in march, will take critical steps to empower women to negotiate for equal pay, to create strong incentives for employers to obey the laws that are in place, and to strengthen federal outreach and enforcement efforts. the act is designed to prevent pay discrimination and help to close the wage gap nationwide. </p><p>the first 81 nevada women to sign letters urging the nevada congressional delegation to support the paycheck fairness act are: </p><p>ivet aldaba <br/> nedra armstrong <br/> margie bowman <br/> christiane brown <br/> willia chaney <br/> jennifer dimarzio <br/> vilma gorre <br/> nicole lawson <br/> adriana martinez <br/> phyllis matsuda <br/> toni mims <br/> rebecca pamais-sellers <br/> jennifer roberts <br/> alicia shipp <br/> janice valdez <br/> cindy reid <br/> nancy alf <br/> roxana ayakawa <br/> gwen braimoh <br/> susan bunyan <br/> samantha charles <br/> pam egan <br/> carol harter <br/> rozita lee <br/> susie martinez <br/> peggy maze johnson <br/> kathleen montes <br/> felicia pellegalle <br/> kathleen robins <br/> carol lee skervin <br/> betty valdez <br/> katie wolken <br/> carmen james ancher <br/> amie belmonte <br/> jennifer braster <br/> gail burks <br/> rosemary congero <br/> kathy england <br/> jessica hoffman <br/> esther lee <br/> gina martinez <br/> aquonetta mccollough <br/> dana myers <br/> loganayagie provost <br/> emma rodriguez <br/> gloria sturman <br/> yolanda villanueva <br/> anna winman <br/> veronica arana <br/> katherine bennett <br/> elizabeth brickfield <br/> virginia cain <br/> liz carrasco <br/> ann fields <br/> verlia hoggard-davis <br/> patty liemel <br/> consuelo martinez <br/> roxanne mccoy <br/> dedee nave <br/> jacki ramirez <br/> ramona sanchez <br/> tiffany (candidate last) <br/> donna watson <br/> sherri rice <br/> jesica arana <br/> chelsea bibb <br/> joy brittingham <br/> brenda chaney <br/> frankie sue del papa <br/> danica daneshforouz <br/> jesse danen <br/> sherril jaske <br/> cecelia maldonado <br/> evelyn mastumoto <br/> nelida mckellar <br/> carmen oliveras <br/> margarita rebollal <br/> sharon scroggins <br/> mai tieu <br/> vicki orozco <br/> elvira diaz </p><p>nevadans for hillary is asking residents to join these 81 women by writing letters asking members of the state's congressional delegation to support the paycheck fairness act. a sample letter may be downloaded at www.(candidate full).com or obtained, along with a list of nevada congressional delegation addresses, by emailing nvvolunteers@(candidate full).com. </p><p>according to the national committee on pay equity, working women stand to lose $250,000 over the course of a career because of unequal pay practices -- a difference in pay that cannot be explained by experience, education, or other qualifications. at the current rate of change, working women in nevada will not achieve equal pay until 2020. nationally, women will not achieve equal pay until after 2050. </p><p>the wage gap hurts women in all aspects of their lives. for example, more than 21 percent of nevada women are without health insurance, and nearly 12 percent of women live below the poverty line. </p><p>the paycheck fairness act was originally introduced during the 109th congress, with 18 co-sponsors -- including senate majority leader harry reid of nevada. senator (candidate last) re-introduced the act this march, during women's history month.</p></span>
