<span class="displaytext">"i hear all the time from people in florida and michigan that they want their voices heard in selecting the (PARTY NAME) nominee. <p>"i believe our nominee will need the enthusiastic support of (PARTY NAME) in these states to win the general election, and so i will ask my (PARTY NAME) convention delegates to support seating the delegations from florida and michigan. i know not all of my delegates will do so and i fully respect that decision. but i hope to be president of all 50 states and u.s. territories, and that we have all 50 states represented and counted at the (PARTY NAME) convention. </p><p>"i hope my fellow potential nominees will join me in this. </p><p>"i will of course be following the no-campaigning pledge that i signed, and expect others will as well."</p></span>
