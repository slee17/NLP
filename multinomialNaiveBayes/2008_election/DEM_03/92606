<span class="displaytext"><b>leaders agree: hillary will bring the change we need to a troubled education system</b> <p>on a media teleconference today, (candidate last) nevada chair rory reid announced the formation of the nevada educators leadership council, a group of prominent educators and active members of the education community endorsing (candidate last)'s bid for the presidency. two of the founding council members, former clark county school district superintendent brian cram and former state superintendent of schools eugene paslov, joined reid for the announcement. the council will advise the campaign and lead efforts to mobilize support among educators for the january 19 caucus. </p><p>"senator (candidate last) has earned my support through her decades of action on behalf of children," said council member sarah mersereau-adler, carson high school english teacher. "by declaring it takes a whole village to raise a child, she understands that to learn, children must be healthy - and she will provide health care for all of them and their families. she knows that to want to learn, children need to feel they have a future, and she has responded with her youth opportunity agenda, which begins with early childhood education. senator (candidate last) values the commitment we educators have made to children, and she also understands the challenges we face with growing school populations and cramped facilities. as an author of the transition to teaching program and school leadership program, hillary has fought to recruit and train excellent teachers for nevada and the nation. (candidate full)'s tireless work to improve our nation's school systems solidifies my support for her bid for the presidency." </p><p>"making sure our schools and children achieve high standards is an important part of ensuring america's future and position in the global economy," said dr. mark dominguez, jim thorpe elementary school principal. "however, the well intentioned but under-funded no child left behind act fails to strike the balance between high standards and well-rounded curricula. the no child left behind act is accountability without capacity. school systems must have the capacity and resources to be able to meet the challenges of school accountability, otherwise accountability demands and sanctions are meaningless and often harmful. (candidate full) is an advocate for increasing the program's funding and reforming its failures. whether it's expanding schooling for pre-k or fighting for increases in federal funding to build new schools, (candidate full) is a proven champion of improving our education system. the time is now to put her skills and vision to work in the white house." </p><p>"the members of this council know that nevada needs a president with a demonstrated commitment to improving education and an understanding of the problems that face our education system at all levels," said (candidate last) nevada chair rory reid. "the campaign is privileged to have the support of an amazing group of leaders who have devoted their lives to preparing the leaders of tomorrow. their community knowledge and networks will play a vital role in mobilizing support for the caucus." </p><p>the founding members of (candidate full)'s nevada educators leadership council, announced today, are: </p><p>stacie anthony, forensics teacher, north las vegas<br/> rene cantu, education advocate, las vegas<br/> richard carranza, educator, las vegas<br/> brian cram, former superintendent clark county school district, las vegas<br/> chemene crawford, educator, las vegas<br/> dick collins, lifelong educator, las vegas<br/> cathy dreher, retired school administrator, reno<br/> jeanne donadio, educator, las vegas<br/> mark jose dominguez, educator and school principal, henderson<br/> claudia fadness, school administrator, fernley<br/> nancy fitzgerald, elementary school teacher, reno<br/> charles fulkerson, former assistant professor of military science, reno<br/> chris giunchigliani, special education teacher, clark county commissioner, las vegas<br/> mary griswold, education researcher, reno<br/> jeffrey geihs, educator and school principal, las vegas<br/> rabin gokol, american history teacher, las vegas<br/> rosemary hall, educator, las vegas<br/> carol harter, former president, university of nevada, las vegas<br/> susan hastings, high school science teacher, reno<br/> billy holben, educator, reno<br/> marsha irvin, educator, north las vegas<br/> gaye johnston, retired teacher; churchill county partners in education, former executive director, fallon <br/> sandra mack, educator, las vegas<br/> ronan matthew, canyon springs high school, principal, north las vegas<br/> kevin mcpartlin, change advocate, las vegas<br/> jackie mcritchie, retired educator, henderson<br/> sarah mersereau-adler, high school teacher, carson city<br/> eva melendrez, educator, las vegas<br/> glenn miller, phd, university professor, reno<br/> scott millard, math teacher, hug high school, reno<br/> eugene paslov, former nevada state superintendent of schools, carson city<br/> sandra patterson, educator, las vegas<br/> bridget phillips, educator and parent, las vegas<br/> charlotte polise, retired public school teacher, elko<br/> micheal polise, music teacher, duck valley indian reservation, elko<br/> taylor s. powers, ready for change, las vegas<br/> john patrick rice, phd, director of institutional advancement, great basin college, elko<br/> jennifer ring, university professor of political science, reno<br/> judy roberts, professional educator, henderson<br/> tom rodriguez, educator, henderson<br/> carlos romo, director of equity and diversity office, truckee meadows community college, education advocate, reno<br/> peggy breeding rosch, educator, las vegas<br/> joyce schoenberg, administrator, university of nevada, reno<br/> stephanie smith, educator; north las vegas city councilwoman <br/> william sullivan, college administrator, las vegas<br/> daniel tafoya, educator, las vegas<br/> teresa testa, educator, las vegas, las vegas<br/> dina titus, minority leader nevada state senate; college professor, las vegas<br/> neftali torres, community activist, north las vegas<br/> mary ann toth, advocate for children's education, las vegas<br/> porter troutman, educator, las vegas<br/> jolene wallace, professional educator, las vegas<br/> valerie waroway, educator, las vegas <br/> joyce woodhouse, former educator; nevada state senator, henderson<br/> george workman, retired teacher, former churchill county school board trustee, fallon</p></span>
