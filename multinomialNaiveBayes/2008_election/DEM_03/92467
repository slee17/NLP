<span class="displaytext"><b>shaheen announces decision to step down as (candidate last) campaign co-chair</b> <p>"i would like to reiterate that i deeply regret my comments yesterday and say again that they were in no way authorized by senator (candidate last) or the (candidate last) campaign. senator (candidate last) has been running a positive campaign focused on the issues that matter to america's families. she is the best qualified to be the next president of the united states because she can lead starting on day one. i made a mistake and in light of what happened, i have made the personal decision that i will step down as the co-chair of the hillary for president campaign. this election is too important and we must all get back to electing the best qualified candidate who has the record of making change happen in this country. that candidate is (candidate full)."</p></span>
