<span class="displaytext"><b>washington, dc</b> – "more than 65,000 immigrant students will graduate from u.s. high schools this year only to see the doors of opportunity closed to them. these are gifted and highly motivated children who grew up in the united states. for these children, many of whom arrived to this country as babies, america is the only home they know. they speak english fluently, and for many it is their first and only language. many have never even visited the country of their birth. they have been educated in our public school system. they have stayed in school and stayed out of trouble. these kids are honor students, team captains, student body presidents and valedictorians. <p>"many would like nothing more than to contribute to the only country they've ever known as home. but for these children, because of their immigration status, they are often effectively barred from pursuing a post-secondary education and reaching their full potential. through no fault of their own, they are forced to live in the shadows and denied their chance at achieving their god given potential. </p><p>"what are we saying to these hard working students? well i will tell you. we are saying they are not welcome in the only country they have ever known. we are telling them to go back to another country they often know little about, where they may not speak the language, or understand the culture. these are children caught at a crossroads, and rather than providing them with an opportunity, we are holding them accountable for the actions of their parents. </p><p>"this is not the america i know. </p><p>"there is a solution to this crisis, but sadly, the senate today failed to act. the dream act – which i have proudly cosponsored for several years – would help expand opportunities for our nation's immigrant children. for those students who have grown up in the united states, have demonstrated good moral character, and are pursuing a college education or have enlisted in the military, the dream act will provide an opportunity to earn legal status in this country. </p><p>"there are many good reasons to enact the dream act. in today's twenty-first century economy, where a post-secondary education is quickly becoming the minimum requirement for higher-earning jobs, we need to provide the children in our country with every opportunity to achieve academically, both for their benefit but also for the benefit of our society. the dream act would also strengthen our nation's military readiness, allowing these well-qualified young men and women to serve their country with honor. but most importantly, the dream act ensures that the promise of the american dream becomes a reality for all our children. </p><p>"i am disappointed that the senate failed to pass the dream act. the enactment of this legislation is long overdue, and i will continue to fight for its passage, for all of our children and our nation."</p></span>
