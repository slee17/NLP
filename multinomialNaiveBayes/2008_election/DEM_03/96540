<span class="displaytext"><i>below are excerpts of (candidate full)'s prepared remarks for this afternoon's "solutions for america" rally in fort worth, texas: </i> <p>...my opponent and i are in an important debate about national security - and which one of us is best prepared to take charge as commander-in-chief. </p><p>he calls that fear-mongering. </p><p>well, i don't think texans scare that easy. </p><p>we know we have a job to do - to end the war in iraq and win the war in afghanistan. </p><p>when my opponent says it's fear-mongering to talk about who is ready to protect america, i say: if you can't have that debate with me, how can you have it with (candidate full)? </p><p>we are running for the most important job in the world, and you can't run away from a debate on national security. - - - </p><p>"my opponent talks about a speech he gave on iraq in 2002. well, there's a big difference between giving a speech at an anti-war rally and giving orders as commander-in-chief. when a crisis comes and that phone rings at 3 a.m. in the white house, you don't have time for speeches. you don't have time for on-the-job training. </p><p>he talks about these issues, but then he goes missing in action. </p><p>he gave his speech about iraq when he was running for the senate, but two years later he said he agreed with the way george bush was conducting the war. </p><p>he's running an ad that touts his position on afghanistan. he chairs a subcommittee on nato, which is a major ally in the war in afghanistan. but he failed to hold a single substantive hearing on afghanistan or anything else. </p><p>he even went missing on an important vote on iran.</p></span>
