<span class="displaytext">today the bush administration took a step forward in addressing the systemic problems in no child left behind through a pilot that will allow 10 states to create more nuanced systems of school accountability. while a small pilot, this is a long overdue step in the right direction. by allowing states to differentiate between schools that need modest improvements and those that are chronically failing, this pilot will provide some much-needed flexibility. <p>this step, however, should be just the beginning. no child left behind is a failed policy that needs fundamental overhaul - not tinkering around the edges. the one-size-fits-all approach of nclb is simply not working, and today's announcement signals that the bush administration is beginning to acknowledge that. as president, i will work with congress to end the no child left behind act, and put in its place a more sensible law that stops micromanaging our schools from the federal level and provides real support to struggling schools.</p></span>
