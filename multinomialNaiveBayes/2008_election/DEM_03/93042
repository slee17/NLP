<span class="displaytext">"the simple act of declaring who you are has often been a moment of courage for many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (lgbt) americans. national coming out day honors the brave journey many have taken out of the closet. but even now, after so much progress has been made in the fight for equality and acceptance, many in the lgbt community continue to face discrimination and harassment. <p>"as president, i will end the divisive politics of this administration and work to renew the promise of fairness for all americans. this means supporting equal rights for gay and lesbian couples, ending don't ask don't tell and allowing patriotic americans to serve their country, and finally signing into law the employment non-discrimination act and hate crimes legislation. </p><p>"so on this day, twenty years after the second march on washington for lesbian and gay rights, let us rededicate ourselves to the ideal that all americans should be treated equally, no matter who you are or who you love."</p></span>
