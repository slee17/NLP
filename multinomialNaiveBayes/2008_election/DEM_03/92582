<span class="displaytext"><b>congresswoman matsui endorses and will serve as national campaign co-chair and chair of aapis for hillary</b> <p>on wednesday, (candidate full) announced the launch of asian americans and pacific islanders (aapi) for hillary, a national initiative to organize and mobilize aapi supporters. (candidate last) made the announcement at an event to celebrate asian pacific american heritage month attended by leaders of the aapi community. in conjunction with the launch of aapis for hillary, congresswoman doris matsui announced her endorsement of (candidate full) for president and agreed to serve as national campaign co-chair and the national chair of aapis for hillary. </p><p>"asian americans and pacific islanders have a huge opportunity to make a difference in this election," said congresswoman matsui. "(candidate full) has been a consistent champion and friend of the aapi community. she is ready to be our next president and the aapi community is ready to support her. i look forward to leading the charge to help make hillary the candidate of choice for aapi voters." </p><p>in addition to congresswoman matsui, aapis for hillary will be led by prominent leaders from across the country. as part of this effort, the campaign announced organizational leadership in six states/regions as well as committees focused on outreach for each ethnic group within the aapi community (full committee list below). the committees are expected to expand over the next several months, and the nevada committee of aapis for hillary is expected to launch next month. already, thousands of aapis have actively supported (candidate full)'s campaign by participating in fundraising and grassroots activity. aapis for hillary will harness the enthusiasm to grow this group of committed supporters and get them involved in new and existing campaign activities. </p><p>"many americans, including we in the aapi community, are ready for a change in leadership in the white house," said hawaii state senate president colleen hanabusa. "hillary is ready to tackle the tough issues in this country that have been ignored for too long. from immigration to health care to our role in the world, hillary will be able to lead this country from day one and help us reclaim the american dream." </p><p>according to the census bureau, the aapi community is the fastest growing ethnic group in the country and currently represents five percent of the total population. aapis have particular political strength in several early caucus/primary states. for example, in california, the number of aapis eligible to vote has more than doubled from 1990 to 2005. currently, there are 2.5 million eligible aapi voters in california, representing 12 percent of california voters. </p><p>"aapis in california will play a major role in determining the next president of the united states," said assemblymember fiona ma, majority whip for the california assembly. "it's clear that (candidate full) understands the significance of this community, and i'm proud to support her candidacy." </p><p>aapis will also play a significant role in nevada where aapis represent 4.6 percent of eligible voters. there is also a tremendous opportunity to engage new aapi voters in nevada. according to apia vote, a national nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that encourages and promotes civic participation of the aapi community, only 42 percent of eligible aapis were registered to vote in 2002. </p><p>"i am thrilled to have the support of so many asian americans and pacific islanders, and in particular, leaders like doris matsui," said (candidate full). "we're not taking any vote for granted, and i want the aapi community to know that i hope to earn their vote. together, we can rededicate our efforts to creating better opportunities and brighter futures for all americans." </p><p>in the senate, hillary has championed numerous initiatives to improve the lives of aapis, their families and communities. last year hillary introduced legislation that would reunite families who have been separated by the immigration system. in addition, she sponsored the legal immigrant children's health improvement act to restore access to medicaid and schip benefits for legal immigrant pregnant women and children and introduced the access to employment and english language acquisition act to provide more job training funds for individuals with limited english language skills. as president, (candidate full) will promote an agenda that provides the opportunity, support and tools that aapis need to realize the american dream and address the challenges facing the community, including discrimination, language barriers, and poor access to affordable health care. </p><p><b>about congresswoman matsui</b> </p><p>congresswoman matsui was elected to congress in 2005 to represent sacramento and its surrounding areas. she replaced her husband, the late congressman robert matsui. during her first week in congress, congresswoman matsui signed on as a co-sponsor of bipartisan legislation to expand the number of stem cell lines available for vital medical research. since lending her support to that first bill, she has worked to bring sacramento's voice to legislation focusing on reducing prescription drug prices, expanding access to affordable health care, balancing national security needs with civil liberties, and implementing good government policies. </p><p><b>aapis for hillary steering committee</b> </p><p><b>national chair: united states representative matsui</b> </p><p><b>national chair aapi women for hillary: irene natividad, president of globalwomen inc.;
