<span class="displaytext"><i>(candidate full) delivered the following statement at the alliance for american manufacturing forum in pittsburgh, pa earlier today.</i> <p>for video, <i>[click here]</i> </p><p>"i am well aware that at a fundraiser in san francisco, he said some things that many people in pennsylvania and beyond pennsylvania have found offensive. he was explaining to a small group of his donors what people who live in small towns right here in pennsylvania are like and why some of you aren't voting for him. but instead of looking at himself, he blamed them. </p><p>"he said that they cling to religion and guns and dislike people who are different from them. well, i don't believe that. i believe that people don't cling to religion, they value their faith. you don't cling to guns, you enjoy hunting or collecting or sport shooting. </p><p>"i don't think he really gets it that people are looking for a president who stands up for you and not looks down on you. </p><p>"after seven years of americans feeling invisible to this president, president bush, it's time that we level the playing field and begin acting like americans again. and that means we roll up our sleeves and we get to work making our country what we know it can be. </p><p>"and i think it's time we turned words into action. as a great pennsylvanian once said, ben franklin, "well done is better than well said." and that's what you're doing here and that's what i want to do with you. we're going to get things done. we're going to take action. we're going to bring people together. and i want you to hold me accountable."</p></span>
