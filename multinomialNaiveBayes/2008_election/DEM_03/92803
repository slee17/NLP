<span class="displaytext"><b>to: interested parties<br/> from: mark penn, chief strategist<br/> date: wednesday, february 13, 2008<br/> re: the path to the nomination </b> <p>this election will come down to delegates. votes are still being counted and delegates apportioned, but (candidate full) and (candidate full) are separated by approximately 40 delegates right now - that is, barely 1% of all the delegates to the (PARTY NAME) convention. </p><p>change begins march 4th. hillary leads in the three largest, delegate rich states remaining: texas, ohio and pennsylvania. these three states have 492 delegates - 64 percent of the remaining delegates (candidate full) needs to win the nomination. according to the latest polls, hillary leads in texas (ivr jan 30-31), pennsylvania (franklin &amp; marshall jan 8-14) and ohio (columbus dispatch jan 23-31). after march 4th, over 3000 delegates will be committed, and we project that (candidate full) and (candidate full) will be virtually tied with 611 delegates still to be chosen in pennsylvania and other remaining states. this does not even include florida and michigan (where hillary won 178 delegates), whose votes we believe should be counted. </p><p>the reason hillary is so strong in ohio, texas and pennsylvania is that her message of delivering solutions resonates strongly with voters in those states. hillary is the only candidate who can deliver the economic change voters want - the only candidate with a real plan and a record of fighting for health care, housing, job creation and protecting social security. </p><p>the demographics in these states also favor (candidate full). hillary won among white women by 6 points in virginia and 18 points in maryland, and white women make up a much bigger share of the electorate in these states (41% of 2004 ohio (PARTY NAME) primary voters, for instance, compared with only 33-35% of 2008 maryland and virginia (PARTY NAME) primary voters). hillary has also won large majorities among latinos nationwide - 73% in new york, 67% in california, 68% in new jersey, 62% in new mexico, 59% in florida and 55% in arizona. latinos made up 24% of texas (PARTY NAME) primary voters in 2004, and may be an even larger share in 2008. </p><p>(candidate full) has shown that she has the ability and organization to compete financially and on the ground. she raised 10 million dollars in just three days last week, and will be competitive with (candidate full) in fundraising and tv advertising from now through march 4th and beyond. she has a strong organization in each of these key states and endorsements from governor strickland, rep. stephanie tubbs jones, and former senator john glenn in ohio. hillary had a huge 12,000 person rally in el paso last night to kick off her texas campaign. </p><p>again and again, this race has shown that it is voters and delegates who matter, not the pundits or perceived "momentum." after iowa, every poll gave (candidate full) a strong lead in new hampshire, but he ended up losing the state. and after a defeat in south carolina, (candidate full) went on to win by large margins in california, new york, florida, new jersey, massachusetts, arizona, tennessee, oklahoma and arkansas. </p><p>as history shows, the (PARTY NAME) nomination goes to the candidate who wins the most delegates - not the candidate who wins the most states. in 1992, bill (candidate last) lost a string of primaries before clinching the nomination. he ceded iowa, new hampshire, massachusetts, maryland, arizona, washington, utah, colorado, rhode island, connecticut, delaware, vermont and south dakota. similarly, in 1984, walter mondale also lost a series of major primaries before winning the nomination, including new hampshire, vermont, florida, massachusetts, rhode island, wisconsin, indiana, virginia, south carolina, louisiana, mississippi, colorado, ohio, and california. and in 1976, jimmy carter lost twenty-three states before winning the nomination, including: massachusetts, new york, new jersey, maryland, west virginia, south carolina, alabama, illinois, mississippi, minnesota, north dakota, nebraska, wyoming, montana, idaho, washington, oregon, nevada, california, arizona, alaska, hawaii, and utah.</p></span>
