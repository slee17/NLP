<span class="displaytext">charleston, wv - two west virginia mayors reacted to senator (candidate last)'s comments on small town america today, saying they don't reflect the views of their communities. <p>background: at a fundraiser in san francisco, california, senator (candidate last) shared his views of americans from small towns: "...it's not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations." </p><p>"i am disappointed by senator (candidate last)'s offensive comments about small towns. if sen. (candidate last) came to williamstown, he would find hardworking people doing everything they can to make a better life for their families despite a slowing economy, a difficult war, and a broken health care system. we need a president who will find real solutions to these tough challenges and help small towns get ahead, not one that puts down people for their faith or their values," said <b>mayor of williamstown jean ford.</b> </p><p>"the people in hinton and small towns across america are working hard to get ahead. we need a president who will help us revitalize our communities. i feel that senator (candidate last) understands that we are the heart of this country and is committed to helping us transform our communities from economies of the past to economies of the future," said <b>mayor of hinton cleo mathews.</b> </p><p>for audio of sen.
