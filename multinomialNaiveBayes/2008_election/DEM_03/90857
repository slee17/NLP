<span class="displaytext">i am outraged by news reports that blue cross of california is asking physicians to provide personal medical information about their patients that blue cross can use to deny them health insurance coverage. this is a deliberate effort to pressure physicians to betray the sacred trust they have with their patients. it could lead patients to be less forthcoming about critical medical information. and it could further erode the fragmented and inadequate system of health insurance in california and around the country. <p>this is only the most recent example of how insurance companies spend tens of billions of dollars a year figuring out how to avoid covering people with health insurance. in the current system, insurers profit by cherry picking healthy individuals and avoiding those that may be "expensive," and then trying to avoid paying up once the insured patient actually needs treatment. </p><p>my american health choices plan will finally put an end to these discriminatory practices. insurance companies will no longer be able to deny individuals' coverage because of preexisting conditions or risk factors, or charge exorbitant premiums to screen them out. and individual coverage will be guaranteed, so if you pay your premiums and follow the rules, insurance companies will be required to renew your coverage each year at a price you can afford. </p><p>i am running for president to ensure that no american is ever again discriminated against by insurance companies, and that every american has quality affordable health coverage-no one is left out.</p></span>
