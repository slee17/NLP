<span class="displaytext">i offer my heartfelt congratulations to the people of israel on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the establishment as a state and homeland for the jewish people, and i join all the friends of israel who celebrate today with joy and pride. <p>emerging after the tragedy of the holocaust, the jewish state was reborn after two thousand years, fulfilling the biblical prophecy of a return to zion. since then, in just three score years, israel has welcomed jewish exiles from europe, the arab world, africa, and the former soviet union. </p><p>from my first trip to israel in 1982 to my most recent visit in 2005, i have seen for myself israel's achievements â€“ and its challenges. the people of israel, proud and free and always triumphing in the face of adversity, have built a strong and vibrant democracy, a diverse and rich society, and an innovative and thriving economy. </p><p>yet today, even as we celebrate all that israel has achieved, we know that the jewish state is still not safe. in every generation, israel faces serious challenges to its security and threats to its existence. and just as the united states recognized israel at birth, and has always stood by israel when its survival and well-being were challenged, so too do the american people stand by israel today, united by shared values and strong bonds of friendship. </p><p>as president of the united states, i will be proud to continue and strengthen these bonds, so that the state of israel will continue to grow, from generation to generation, in security and peace. </p><p>am yisrael chai! (the people of israel live!)</p></span>
