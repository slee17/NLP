<span class="displaytext">"the fifth anniversary of president bush's "mission accomplished" speech comes the same week as a chief architect of the bush administration's war in iraq conceded "we were clueless on counterinsurgency." that statement confirms what we have all known: the planning and strategy was flawed. our troops deserved and deserve better. <p>"all americans honor the service and sacrifice of our men and women of the armed forces of the united states in iraq. we are grateful for the tremendous burden they have carried. our troops have done their job. </p><p>"the path forward is to use american diplomacy and our allies to allow u.s. forces to come home, and turn responsibility back to iraq and its people. </p><p>"that is the plan i have laid out to the american people as a senator and as a candidate, and that is the plan that i will carry out as president."</p></span>
