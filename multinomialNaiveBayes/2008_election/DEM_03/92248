<span class="displaytext">david plouffe<br/> p.o. box 8102<br/> (candidate last) for america<br/> chicago, illinois 60680 <p>dear david: </p><p>the 2008 primary campaign has been a spirited contest that has resulted in record voter turnout. both of our candidates can proudly boast of bringing new people into the process and energizing our (PARTY NAME) party. </p><p>with the campaign now entering the final phase of the nominating contest, it is vital that both of our campaigns come together to ensure that the delegations from florida and michigan be seated to reflect the will of the voters. </p><p>in florida and michigan, nearly 2.5 million americans made their voices heard and participated in primary elections. we think the results of those primaries were fair and should be honored. </p><p>over the last few weeks, there has been much discussion about how to ensure that the florida and michigan delegations are seated. we think there are two options: either honor the results or hold new primary elections. </p><p>to that end, we are in active consultation with all of our supporters in florida, including members of congress. in michigan, we are in active consultation with the committee appointed by governor granholm. </p><p>we hope that your campaign will join us in our efforts to ensure that these votes are counted. </p><p>sincerely,<br/> maggie williams<br/> campaign manager</p></span>
