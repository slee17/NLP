<span class="displaytext">last tuesday, senator mcgovern laid out a proposal for concluding the primary process that included joint appearances and party-building efforts by senator (candidate last) and senator (candidate last) in the remaining primary states. at the time, senator daschle indicated that the (candidate last) campaign had "interest in joint appearances." <p>the (candidate last) campaign today released the following statement from state director geoff wetrosky on senator mcgovern's proposal: </p><p>"the (candidate last) campaign in south dakota believes senator mcgovern's proposal is in the best interests of both the party and the nation. </p><p>given the disturbing reports that the (candidate last) camp intends to unilaterally declare this process over before june 3, senator mcgovern should be commended for fighting to ensure that thousands of south dakota voters get to have their say. </p><p>with only a few states remaining, we believe this is a workable proposal that will greatly benefit the citizens of south dakota. hillary has already visited the state twice to discuss her plan to invest in alternative energy and her rural agenda, and she is expected to return; we would welcome a joint appearance where both candidates discuss their plans for south dakota. </p><p>in short: we accept. given senator daschle's comments at the time and senator johnson's declaration that the primary should continue through june 3, we hope senator (candidate last) will join us."</p></span>
