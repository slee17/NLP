<span class="displaytext"><i>the following is a statement from deputy communications director phil singer in response to reports that efforts to hold a new vote in michigan have stalled: </i> <p>when it comes to the michigan and florida primaries, senator (candidate last) seems to only be capable of saying no: no to honoring the january elections, no to holding a new primary vote, no to a vote by mail. the only thing he seems to be for is divvying up delegates in a way that doesn't reflect the will of the electorate. </p><p>senator (candidate last) disagrees with solutions that exclude voters and believes there should be new primary elections in florida and michigan if the january votes can't be honored. it is unacceptable to disenfranchise the voters who participated in january and if senator (candidate last) allows that to happen, there will be implications for (PARTY NAME) in the general election.</p></span>
