<span class="displaytext"><b>oregon's largest paper endorses debates hillary would accept debate offers from across oregon </b> <p>the (candidate last) campaign today announced it would accept any of the seven debates being offered by prominent media, academic and governmental sponsors throughout the state, and challenged sen. (candidate last) to show oregonians he's taking their votes seriously. this offer came on the heels of an editorial in today's oregonian echoing the (candidate last) call for debates. </p><p>"hillary told oregon voters last week that she looked forward to debating the issues important to our state. every other person running for office in oregon agrees to debate, but so far we have been met by stonewalling and silence by the (candidate last) campaign," said josh kardon, chair of the oregon steering committee. "the overwhelming majority of oregonians haven't seen a single presidential debate this year, and we know that hundreds of thousands of oregon voters would be glued to their sets for the first presidential debate in oregon history." </p><p>the oregonian editorial agrees: "an oregon debate between (candidate last) and (candidate last) would be good for democracy here and the country generally. as a general principle, voters should be given the chance to compare the candidates, face to face, in at least one televised event." </p><p><i>[click here]</i> to read more. </p><p>the oregonian is the second major daily paper in the state to endorse debates, following a piece earlier this week in the eugene register guard. ["bring on oregon debates; (candidate last) wants them, (candidate last) doesn't," 4/29/08] </p><p><i>[click here]</i> to read more. </p><p>the (candidate last) campaign is offering to participate in debates hosted by the following prominent sponsors who have stepped forward to host debates on the issues facing oregon and our nation. </p><p>willamette university in salem; <br/> kgw-tv (nbc) in portland; <br/> katu-tv (abc) in portland; <br/> kobi-tv (nbc) in medford; <br/> the city club of portland; <br/> pbs/nova and the american association for the advancement of science; and <br/> association of oregon counties and oregon state university extension service. </p><p>"i understand senator (candidate last) is reluctant to answer tough questions in a debate, so if it would make him more comfortable, hillary is also prepared to debate in a forum hosted by either the oregonian or the eugene register guard - both of which support debates and have already endorsed senator (candidate last)," said kardon. "the two (PARTY NAME) senate candidates have held seven debates this primary season; anyone who wants oregon's vote for president should be willing to debate here."</p></span>
