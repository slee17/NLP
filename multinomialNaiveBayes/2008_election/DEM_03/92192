<span class="displaytext"><b>time magazine's mark halperin names hillary the winner -- 'bottom line: came in the front-runner and leaves in a stronger position':</b> "able to look commanding and presidential even as she fielded niggling, hoary questions that bordered on the absurd. never lost her temper, her focus or her cool, and even dispatched a crowd-pleasing dick cheney zinger. occasionally lapsed into the weary defensiveness she displayed during the health care wars of '93 and various subsequent (candidate last) sagas. bottom line: came in the front-runner and leaves in a stronger position." [time, 6/04/07] <p><b>abc news' george stephanopoulos -- 'she came in the frontrunner. she left the frontrunner':</b> "listen, (candidate full) went into the debate last night as a frontrunner. look at our poll. she was ahead 42%, (candidate full) 27%, (candidate full) 11%. she came in the frontrunner. she left the frontrunner... the strongest best moment of the night belonged to (candidate full) when she was asked do you agree with (candidate full) when he says the war on terror is just a bumper sticker." [good morning america, 6/04/07] </p><p><b>ap analysis -- hillary 'projected an air of confidence and a mastery of the subject matter':</b> "with a new washington post/abc news poll showing (candidate last) far ahead of her rivals nationally, the former first lady projected an air of confidence and a mastery of the subject matter at sunday's forum. she also insisted (PARTY NAME) should focus their policy critiques on (PARTY NAME)s, especially president george w. bush." [ap, 6/4/07] </p><p><b>the atlantic's andrew sullivan -- 'she wins this one. it kills me to admit it. but there you are':</b> "in general, senator (candidate last) bestrode the debate as an authoritative figure. in fact, i've never witnessed a u.s. political debate in which a woman clearly dominated as she did tonight... still: she wins this one. it kills me to admit it. but there you are." [the atlantic, 6/03/07] </p><p><b>wmur focus group -- 'focus group respondents... felt even more strongly about her afterward, increasing her ratings by twenty-one points':</b> "focus group respondents viewed (candidate last) favorably prior to the debate and felt even more strongly about her afterward, increasing her ratings by twenty-one points. interestingly, there was not a gender gap in the response. both men and women evaluated (candidate last) similarly and both groups proportionately increased their favorable evaluations of her."
