<span class="displaytext"><i>(candidate full) put out the following statement in response to reports that president bush personally intervened to order the epa to weaken its new limits on ozone:</i> <p>president bush opened a new front in his administration's war on science this week. his personal intervention to weaken the environmental protection agency's new limits on ozone proves that he has abandoned even a pretense of scientific integrity in decision-making. his efforts are directly at odds not only with accepted science, but with his government's own arguments before the united states supreme court. </p><p>this is only the latest in a long series of examples where the bush administration's perversion of science helps special interests at the expense of public health -- though it is certainly one of the more brazen. i will work with senate environment committee chair barbara boxer to investigate the president's decision and to hold him accountable. </p><p>and when i am president, i will end the bush war on science. and i will work to revise the ozone standard to reflect the available standard and to protect the public health, as the clean air act requires. months ago, i outlined a detailed agenda to restore scientific integrity to government decision-making. i promised that as president i would issue an executive order to revive the longstanding practice of giving experts a central voice in agency rulemaking and call on agencies to pursue evidence-based decisions, and to direct all department and agency heads to safeguard against instances of political pressure threatening scientific integrity and promote openness and transparency in decision-making.</p></span>
