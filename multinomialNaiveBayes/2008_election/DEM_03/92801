<span class="displaytext"><b> to: interested parties<br/> from: mark penn, chief strategist<br/> re: state of play going into the debate </b> <p>what is the most important card in this race? the leadership card. </p><p>that is the card that we see in poll after poll that analyzes why people are voting for (candidate full). </p><p>and so while opponents are strategizing and re-launching their campaigns with aggressive personal attacks on sen. (candidate last), one truth remains – running for president is not a qualification for president. </p><p>the voters are looking for someone who has the strength and experience to lead, and little has changed in the last few weeks outside of the massive media coverage of the attacks. </p><p>as senator (candidate last) has said, change is just a word unless you have the strength and experience to make it happen. </p><p>so let's look at the ratings voters give the three leading candidates on the qualities they look for in a president. </p><p>on the questions of who is best able to handle iraq and iran, (candidate full) is the runaway leader. more than half of (PARTY NAME) primary voters say hillary can best handle iran (52%) and iraq (50%) – more than twice the number for (candidate full) (23% on iraq and 22% on iran) and (candidate full) (14% on iran and 16% on iraq) (abc/washington post oct 29-nov 1). </p><p>senator (candidate last) also has an overwhelming lead among (PARTY NAME) on being knowledgeable and experienced enough to handle the presidency (76% for (candidate last) and 41% for (candidate last)), having the strong leadership qualities needed to be president (72% for (candidate last) and 55% for (candidate last)), being inspirational and an exciting choice for president (64% for (candidate last) and 56% for (candidate last)), being a good commander in chief (63% for (candidate last) and 43% for (candidate last)) and bringing real change to the direction of the country (63% for (candidate last) and 52% for (candidate last)) (nbc/wsj nov 1-5). </p><p>finally, as the polls come in, they show that (candidate last) 2.0 isn't working any better than the previous version. after shifting to a negative attack strategy, (candidate last) remains stalled. </p><p>for example, as the candidates prepare to meet in nevada, a new poll there has (candidate full) leading (candidate full) 51 percent to 23 percent with 11% for (candidate full). (candidate last) leads among nevada likely caucus-goers on having the best chance of beating the (PARTY NAME) nominee in the general election ((candidate last) 63%, (candidate last) 15%, (candidate last) 11%), being the strongest leader ((candidate last) 54%, (candidate last) 21%, (candidate last) 14%), most qualified to be commander in chief ((candidate last) 51%, (candidate last) 20%, (candidate last) 13%), most likely to bring needed change ((candidate last) 49%, (candidate last) 28%, (candidate last) 11%), having taken clear positions on the issues ((candidate last) 42%, (candidate last) 23%, (candidate last) 12%), saying what she believes rather than what voters want to hear ((candidate last) 41%, (candidate last) 23%, (candidate last) 12%), most likeable ((candidate last) 40%, (candidate last) 30%, (candidate last) 20%) and most honest ((candidate last) 37%, (candidate last) 24%, (candidate last) 13%). </p><p>in the national polls, five polls in the last two weeks show (candidate full)'s lead holding steady or increasing in the (PARTY NAME) primary. the latest nbc/wsj poll gives hillary a 22 point lead, up 1 point from september, and yesterday's cook political / rt strategies poll puts hillary 17 points ahead – up from a 13 point advantage in september. ap/ipsos gives hillary a 23 point lead, up 2 points since october, usa today/gallup has her 28 points ahead, compared with 29 points in october and according to newsweek, hillary now leads by 19 points, compared with 21 points in august. </p><p>hillary also leads (candidate full), (candidate full), (candidate full) and (candidate full). she leads (candidate last) by 3 points in the cook/rt strategies poll, 6 points in the usa today / gallup poll, 6 points in the cnn poll, 10 points in the wnbc/marist poll, 4 points in the newsweek poll and 4 points in the abc/washington post poll. her advantage widens against other (PARTY NAME)s – to 9 points over (candidate last), 18 points over (candidate last) and 16 points over (candidate last) in the abc/washington post poll. </p><p>and the states show little change. we know it is a close race in iowa and hillary has a significant lead in new hampshire. </p><p>the latest iowa polls all show a very close race - this week's cbs/nyt poll gives (candidate full) a lead of only 2 points. in new hampshire, hillary has a double-digit lead (15 points in this week's cbs/new york times poll). hillary leads by 10 points in south carolina (winthrop/etv). and in yesterday's quinnipiac ohio poll, hillary's 25 point lead is virtually unchanged from last month. </p><p>meanwhile in the general election, hillary leads (candidate last) in ohio, florida, iowa, missouri, arkansas, virginia, west virginia, kentucky and tennessee – all states the (PARTY NAME) lost in 2004. in fact, if the election were held tomorrow, hillary would win 360 electoral votes compared with 178 electoral votes for (candidate full). and hillary would beat (candidate full), (candidate full) and (candidate full) by similar margins. </p><p>but for all the negative personal attacks, this race comes down to one word – leadership.</p></span>
