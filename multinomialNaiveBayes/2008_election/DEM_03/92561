<span class="displaytext">following is a statement released today by senator (candidate full): <p>"giving the 600,000 residents of the district of columbia their fair representation in congress is long overdue. it is why i applaud the house of representatives for finally passing the dc voting rights act today. our nation was born out of a struggle against taxation without representation. and yet, even as we endeavor to promote democracy around the world, it is shameful that we deny our own american citizens who live in the district the right to voting representation in congress. this injustice tarnishes our democracy as a whole. the right to be represented in the national legislature is fundamental to our core american values. </p><p>"i hope the senate will act swiftly to pass the dc voting rights act and that the president will not delay in signing this long overdue legislation into law."</p></span>
