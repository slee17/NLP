<span class="displaytext"><b>to: interested parties<br/> from: neera tanden, policy director<br/> date: wednesday, february 13, 2008<br/> re: senator (candidate last)'s economic speech in wisconsin</b> <p>those covering senator (candidate last)'s economic speech in wisconsin today could be forgiven if it felt like deja vu all over again. voters may ask themselves that if senator (candidate last) cannot produce his own ideas on the campaign trail, how will he solve new problems as president? </p><p><i>senator (candidate last)'s only "new" ideas were ones that senator (candidate last) proposed months ago: </i> </p><p><b>his "new" proposal for a national infrastructure bank is one that hillary proposed august 8, 2007.</b> ["i'm proud to co-sponsor senator (candidate last) and senator hagel's national infrastructure bank act that we just introduced to establish a federally-backed independent bank that will evaluate and finance large infrastructure projects by subsidies, loan guarantees, and bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the united states." rebuilding america speech, 8/8/07; s. 1926, 8/1/07] </p><p><b>his "new" proposal to create 5 million green collar jobs was proposed by hillary on november 5, 2007.</b> ["and three, to move us from a carbon-based economy to an efficient, green economy by unleashing a wave of private-sector innovation in clean energy and energy efficiency. i believe that will create at least five million good new jobs from clean energy over the next decade." energy and climate speech, 11/5/07] </p><p><b>google ceo eric schmidt praises hillary's plan to create 5 million green collar jobs</b>, 11/5/07: "by emphasizing the connection between promoting a green efficient economy and job creation, senator (candidate last)'s plan seeks to harness the power of technology and innovation to address one of our most pressing global challenges...the goal of producing 5 million new jobs can be achieved by private sector investment and bipartisan support for increased research and development in efficiency and clean energy." </p><p>in addition, while senator (candidate last) was busy resuscitating hillary's policies, he failed to offer real solutions for the most pressing economic challenges that americans families face. as hillary explained this morning, "a plan that fails to provide universal health care, fails to address the housing crisis, and fails to immediately start creating good paying jobs in america again will not turn the economy around and provide the real relief that our people need. we need real results not more rhetoric."</p></span>
