<span class="displaytext"><b>to: interested parties<br/> from: (candidate last) campaign<br/> date: wednesday, march 12, 2008<br/> re: keystone test: (candidate last) losing ground</b><p>the path to 1600 pennsylvania avenue goes through pennsylvania so if (candidate full) can't win there, how will he win the general election? </p><p>after setbacks in ohio and texas, (candidate full) needs to demonstrate that he can win the state of pennsylvania. pennsylvania is the last state with more than 15 electoral votes on the primary calendar and (candidate full) has lost six of the seven other largest states so far - every state except his home state of illinois. </p><p>pennsylvania is of particular importance, along with ohio, florida and michigan, because it is dominated by the swing voters who are critical to a (PARTY NAME) victory in november. no (PARTY NAME) has won the presidency without winning pennsylvania since 1948. and no candidate has won the (PARTY NAME) nomination without winning pennsylvania since 1972. </p><p>but the (candidate last) campaign has just announced that it is turning its attention away from pennsylvania. </p><p>this is not a strategy that can beat (candidate full) in november. </p><p>in the last two weeks, (candidate full) has lost ground among men, women, (PARTY NAME), independents and (PARTY NAME)s - all of which point to a candidacy past its prime. </p><p>for example, just a few weeks ago, (candidate full) won 68% of men in virginia, 67% in wisconsin and 62% in maryland. he won 60% of virginia women and 55% of maryland women. he won 62% of independents in maryland, 64% in wisconsin and 69% in virginia. (candidate last) won 59% of (PARTY NAME) in maryland, 53% in wisconsin and 62% in virginia. and among (PARTY NAME)s, (candidate last) won 72% in both virginia and wisconsin. </p><p>but now (candidate last)'s support has dropped among all these groups. </p><p>in mississippi, he won only 25% of (PARTY NAME)s and barely half of independents. in ohio, he won only 48% of men, 41% of women and 42% of (PARTY NAME). in texas, he won only 49% of independents and 46% of (PARTY NAME). and in rhode island, (candidate last) won just 33% of women and 37% of (PARTY NAME). </p><p>why are so many voters turning away from (candidate full) in state after state? </p><p>in the last few weeks, questions have arisen about (candidate last)'s readiness to be president. in virginia, 56% of (PARTY NAME) primary voters said (candidate last) was most qualified to be commander-in-chief. that number fell to 37% in ohio, 35% in rhode island and 39% in texas. </p><p>so the late deciders - those making up their minds in the last days before the election - have been shifting to (candidate full). among those who made their decision in the last three days, (candidate last) won 55% in virginia and 53% in wisconsin, but only 43% in mississippi, 40% in ohio, 39% in texas and 37% in rhode island. </p><p>if (candidate full) cannot reverse his downward spiral with a big win in pennsylvania, he cannot possibly be competitive against (candidate full) in november.</p></span>
