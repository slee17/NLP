(candidate last)'s fiery oratory, but we cannot support his candidacy. the former senator from north carolina has repudiated so many of his earlier positions, so many of his senate votes, that we're not sure where he stands. we certainly don't buy the notion that he can hold back the tide of globalization. </p><p>by choosing mrs. (candidate last), we are not denying mr. (candidate last)'s appeal or his gifts. the idea of the first african-american nominee of a major party also is exhilarating, and so is the prospect of the first woman nominee. "firstness" is not a reason to choose. the times that false choice has been raised, more often by mrs. (candidate last), have tarnished the campaign. </p><p>mr. (candidate last) and mrs. (candidate last) would both help restore america's global image, to which president bush has done so much grievous harm. they are committed to changing america's role in the world, not just its image. on the major issues, there is no real gulf separating the two. they promise an end to the war in iraq, more equitable taxation, more effective government spending, more concern for social issues, a restoration of civil liberties and an end to the politics of division of george w. bush and karl rove. </p><p>mr. (candidate last) has built an exciting campaign around the notion of change, but holds no monopoly on ideas that would repair the governing of america. mrs. (candidate last) sometimes overstates the importance of rã©sumã©. hearing her talk about the presidency, her policies and answers for america's big problems, we are hugely impressed by the depth of her knowledge, by the force of her intellect and by the breadth of, yes, her experience. </p><p>it is unfair, especially after seven years of mr. bush's inept leadership, but any (PARTY NAME) will face tougher questioning about his or her fitness to be commander in chief. mrs. (candidate last) has more than cleared that bar, using her years in the senate well to immerse herself in national security issues, and has won the respect of world leaders and many in the american military. she would be a strong commander in chief. </p><p>domestically, mrs. (candidate last) has tackled complex policy issues, sometimes failing. she has shown a willingness to learn and change. her current proposals on health insurance reflect a clear shift from her first, famously disastrous foray into the issue. she has learned that powerful interests cannot simply be left out of the meetings. she understands that all americans must be covered - but must be allowed to choose their coverage, including keeping their current plans. mr. (candidate last) may also be capable of tackling such issues, but we have not yet seen it. voters have to judge candidates not just on the promise they hold, but also on the here and now. </p><p>the sense of possibility, of a generational shift, rouses mr. (candidate last)'s audiences and not just through rhetorical flourishes. he shows voters that he understands how much they hunger for a break with the bush years, for leadership and vision and true bipartisanship. we hunger for that, too. but we need more specifics to go with his amorphous promise of a new governing majority, a clearer sense of how he would govern. </p><p>the potential upside of a great (candidate last) presidency is enticing, but this country faces huge problems, and will no doubt be facing more that we can't foresee. the next president needs to start immediately on challenges that will require concrete solutions, resolve, and the ability to make government work. mrs. (candidate last) is more qualified, right now, to be president. </p><p>we opposed president bush's decision to invade iraq and we disagree with mrs. (candidate last)'s vote for the resolution on the use of force. that's not the issue now; it is how the war will be ended. mrs. (candidate last) seems not only more aware than mr. (candidate last) of the consequences of withdrawal, but is already thinking through the diplomatic and military steps that will be required to contain iraq's chaos after american troops leave. </p><p>on domestic policy, both candidates would turn the government onto roughly the same course - shifting resources to help low-income and middle-class americans, and broadening health coverage dramatically. mrs. (candidate last) also has good ideas about fixing the dysfunction in mr. bush's no child left behind education program. </p><p>mr. (candidate last) talks more about the damage mr. bush has done to civil liberties, the rule of law and the balance of powers. mrs. (candidate last) is equally dedicated to those issues, and more prepared for the herculean task of figuring out exactly where, how and how often the government's powers have been misused — and what must now be done to set things right. </p><p>as strongly as we back her candidacy, we urge mrs. (candidate last) to take the lead in changing the tone of the campaign. it is not good for the country, the (PARTY NAME) party or for mrs. (candidate last), who is often tagged as divisive, in part because of bitter feeling about her husband's administration and the so-called permanent campaign. (indeed, bill (candidate last)'s overheated comments are feeding those resentments, and could do long-term damage to her candidacy if he continues this way.) </p><p>we know that she is capable of both uniting and leading. we saw her going town by town through new york in 2000, including places where (candidate last)-bashing was a popular sport. she won over skeptical voters and then delivered on her promises and handily won re-election in 2006. </p><p>mrs. (candidate last) must now do the same job with a broad range of america's voters. she will have to let americans see her power to listen and lead, but she won't be able to do it town by town. </p><p>when we endorsed mrs. (candidate last) in 2006, we were certain she would continue to be a great senator, but since her higher ambitions were evident, we wondered if she could present herself as a leader to the nation. </p><p>her ideas, her comeback in new hampshire and strong showing in nevada, her new openness to explaining herself and not just her programs, and her abiding, powerful intellect show she is fully capable of doing just that. she is the best choice for the (PARTY NAME) party as it tries to regain the white house.</p></span>
