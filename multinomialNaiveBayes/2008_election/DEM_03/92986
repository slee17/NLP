<span class="displaytext"><b>"ap-pew poll: (candidate last), strong on key issues, has edge in iowa"</b> <p>by alan fram and trevor tompson associated press writers </p><p>washington (ap) - health care and iraq dominate (PARTY NAME)' concerns in the three pivotal early voting states of the 2008 presidential race. advantage: hillary rodham (candidate last), a poll shows. </p><p>(candidate last) has clear leads in new hampshire and south carolina, building on her ownership of the health-care issue and her broad but more fragile trust among (PARTY NAME) on iraq, the survey showed monday. yet she could stumble in iowa, whose jan. 3 caucuses will be the first voting and where she is in a scramble with (candidate full), trailed closely by (candidate full). </p><p>an extensive poll in the three states by the associated press and the nonpartisan pew research center finds (PARTY NAME) enthusiastic about their overall presidential field. most rate it strongly, and they spiritedly back the contenders they prefer. </p><p>the poll shows (candidate last)'s advantages in the early contests stretch beyond the top issues. the new york senator has amassed strong support among crucial groups including female, older, less-educated and lower-income (PARTY NAME) _ significant because women and older voters in particular have dominated these primaries and caucuses in the past. in iowa though, she has only a modest lead over (candidate last) among women. </p><p>"she knows how to deal with the opposition, she can get national health care passed and stop the war in iraq," said steven arcone, 63, a geophysicist and (candidate last) supporter from west lebanon, n.h. </p><p>the ap-pew poll shows: </p><ul> <li style="margin-bottom:1em;">(candidate last) essentially tied with (candidate last) in iowa, 31 percent to 26 percent, with (candidate last) at 19 percent and new mexico gov. (candidate full) at 10 percent. </li> <li style="margin-bottom:1em;">in new hampshire (candidate last) 38 percent, (candidate last) 19 percent, (candidate last) 15 percent, (candidate last) 10 percent. </li> <li style="margin-bottom:1em;">in south carolina (candidate last) 45 percent, (candidate last) 31 percent, (candidate last) 10 percent. </li> </ul> <p>(candidate last) and (candidate last) haven't taken title to any issues with party voters in the three states, the poll shows, though (candidate last) is close to (candidate last) on immigration and job creation. unfortunately for the illinois senator, neither concern is more than a blip for (PARTY NAME), with only one in 20 listing them atop the agenda. </p><p>the two men have only scattered strength among (PARTY NAME) blocs, with (candidate last)'s strongest backing coming from (PARTY NAME)-leaning independents, liberal, younger and better-educated voters. that is especially true in iowa, which has helped vault him into contention there. </p><p>(candidate last), the former north carolina senator, has yet to lay claim to any critical group of (PARTY NAME) in the three states. </p><p>even among blacks who comprise about half of (PARTY NAME) primary voters in south carolina, (candidate last) does no better than break even with (candidate last). she offsets that by leading him by three-to-one among the state's whites. there are few black voters in iowa or new hampshire. </p><p>"we need somebody right now who can address" iraq and health care, said j.w. sanders sr., 78, pastor of bethel baptist church in gaffney, s.c. "this isn't something i have against (candidate last). but i feel we must look now beyond gender as well as race." </p><p>(PARTY NAME) in each state overwhelmingly call (candidate last) the (PARTY NAME) with the best chance of winning the white house. yet that doesn't carry the weight it did in 2003, when it helped sen. john kerry of massachusetts win the nomination. not even one in four says he would prefer an electable candidate to one with whom he agrees on the issues - more than 10 percentage points fewer than in 2003 in iowa and new hampshire, and about the same as said so then in south carolina. </p><p>in all three early states, (PARTY NAME) trust (candidate last) more than her rivals on iraq, though by smaller numbers than she gets nationally from her party. even so, she has small double-digit leads over (candidate last) and (candidate last) in iowa and new hampshire when (PARTY NAME) are asked which candidate would make the wisest decisions about the war, and is tied with (candidate last) in south carolina. </p><p>all top (PARTY NAME) have said they want to end the war, though (candidate last) has drawn criticism for her 2002 vote supporting the use of force against saddam hussein and for saying she would continue combat operations against al-qaida in iraq. strong majorities of (PARTY NAME) want to bring the troops home. </p><p>on health care, no rival approaches the support (candidate last) wins from party voters. the 41 percent in iowa who say she would best improve the country's medical system is double the support for (candidate last) and (candidate last), and she boasts even wider leads in new hampshire and iowa. </p><p>(candidate last) and (candidate last) want universal health coverage, while (candidate last) would expand coverage but not require people to buy insurance. in each state surveyed, eight in 10 (PARTY NAME) favored government-guaranteed health insurance, even if it means higher taxes. </p><p>iraq and health care are essentially tied in all three states as concerns (PARTY NAME) most want presidential candidates to address, with each named by roughly one-third. </p><p>despite (candidate last)'s leads in new hampshire and south carolina and her front-runner status nationally, iowa's often unpredictable caucuses threaten to trip her before she can fashion an unstoppable head of steam. </p><p>(candidate last) draws the support of nearly half of women in new hampshire and south carolina. yet in iowa, women split 34 percent for (candidate last), 27 percent for (candidate last) and 17 percent for (candidate last). </p><p>"the things he grew up with, a single mom, working hard to get where he's gotten, i just get a good feeling about him," nola olson, 35, teacher's aide in adel, iowa, said of her candidate, (candidate last). </p><p>he and (candidate last) have more support than (candidate last) as a second choice in iowa - which could be important on caucus night, when candidates with weak support are eliminated. eighteen percent of iowa (PARTY NAME) rule out voting for her - far more than her two chief opponents and approached only by the 12 percent who shun rep. dennis kucinich of ohio. </p><p>mark penn, (candidate last)'s chief strategist, attributes her weaker showing in iowa to a late start there and her husband bill's bypassing the state in his two successful presidential campaigns. (candidate last) pollster cornell belcher says iowa is where the candidate has been most active. </p><p>the telephone survey involved interviews conducted from nov. 7-25 with 460 likely (PARTY NAME) voters in iowa, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.5 points. also interviewed were 594 likely (PARTY NAME) voters in new hampshire, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5 points, and 373 likely (PARTY NAME) voters in south carolina, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 6 points.</p></span>
