<span class="displaytext">to: team rudy<br/> from: brent seaborn, strategy director<br/> date: february 2, 2007<br/> re: rudy and the (PARTY NAME) nomination <p>over the last month or two there has been a good deal of public opinion polling on the 2008 (PARTY NAME) primary race. i thought it would be helpful to take a step back and take a closer look at how voters — particularly (PARTY NAME) primary voters — feel about (candidate full) and why we think we are well-positioned heading in to the primary season. </p><p><strong>americans have a highly favorable opinion of mayor (candidate last)</strong> </p><p>entering the 2008 primary season, (candidate full) is uniquely positioned among potential (PARTY NAME) candidates because of his extremely high favorability ratings. recent public opinion polling shows mayor (candidate last) with 61% approval among adults across the country — according to the abc news/washington post poll (jan. 16-19, 2007). the well respected, bipartisan battleground poll (jan 8-11, 2007) shows the mayor with 65% favorability among likely voters. more importantly, mayor (candidate last) shows an 81% favorable rating among (PARTY NAME)s and only 10% with an unfavorable opinion. </p><p>according to the battleground poll, mayor (candidate last) also has surprisingly high favorability ratings beyond the base: </p><ul> <li>70% of independents are favorable,</li> <li>70% of 35-44 year olds,</li> <li>74% of married women,</li> <li>73% of households married with children,</li> <li>52% of minority voters</li> </ul> <p>the mayor also enjoys strong approval among white evangelical christians (76%) and self-described conservative (PARTY NAME)s (82%). </p><p>in an even more recent poll, gallup (jan. 25-28, 2007) finds mayor (candidate last) also leads among (PARTY NAME)s on 7 of 10 key issues including terrorism, the economy, healthcare and fighting crime. he also leads on 11 of 15 key candidate attributes — including "better understands the problems faced by ordinary americans", "would manage government more effectively" and what i believe to be the single most important factor — "is the stronger leader." </p><p>in sum, while we fully expect these polls to tighten in the months and weeks to come, (PARTY NAME) voters genuinely know and like (candidate full). </p><p>the mayor performs well in opinion pollsthe mayor's exceptionally strong approval ratings also translate in to an advantage on (PARTY NAME) primary ballot tests. in 11 of 13 ballot tests in respected national public opinion polls [fox news, newsweek, time gallup, cnn, nbc/wall street journal, abc/washington post] since last november, mayor (candidate last) has a lead — in fact, his lead is on average, more than 5-points over the next closest candidate. and his ballot strength began to trend upward after the 2006 midterm elections. </p><p>mayor (candidate last) leads in key 2008 primary statesmayor (candidate last) also leads in a series of other states that will likely prove critical in the 2008 (PARTY NAME) primary: </p><p></p><table border="1" cellpadding="2" width="500"> <tbody> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff" height="25"> <td>

particularly when compared to other potential (PARTY NAME) candidates – to win the nomination. </p><p>mayor (candidate last)'s favorable public opinion stems not only from his extraordinary leadership in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and in the uncertainty that followed, but also from a remarkably strong record of accomplishments in fighting crime and turning around new york city's economy in the 1990's. </p><p>americans are anxious for fresh (PARTY NAME) leadership on a range of issues. our voters are drawn to the leadership strength of a candidate during an election. therefore, as we move forward with exploring a run for president and as we continue to share the mayor's story of strong leadership and reagan-like optimism and vision, we hope to see continued growth in our foundation of support.</p></span>
