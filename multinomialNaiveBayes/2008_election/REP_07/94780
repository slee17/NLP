<span class="displaytext"><strong>to: team rudy<br/> from: brent seaborn, strategy director<br/> date: may 2, 2007<br/> re: mayor (candidate last)'s primary and general election strength</strong> <p><strong>(PARTY NAME) primary update</strong> </p><p>as we head into the first (PARTY NAME) presidential debate, mayor (candidate last) has led in every major national poll from the last 14 weeks. since the mayor made clear his intention to seek the (PARTY NAME) nomination for president, he has maintained a double digit lead over his rivals. recent analysis by gallup poll<sup>1</sup> finds mayor (candidate last)'s lead over his closest opponent over the past few weeks has averaged approximately 15-points. </p><p><strong>(candidate full) continues to lead the (PARTY NAME) primary field</strong> </p><p>we expect the dynamics of the (PARTY NAME) race may change in the coming months. however, we are confident we have built strong and durable support — even as we know the polls are likely to tighten considerably. </p><p><strong>(candidate full) leads his (PARTY NAME) rivals in california and other important primary states</strong> </p><p><img align="bottom" alt="" border="0" hspace="0" src="http://www.joinrudy2008.com/photos/pr/5207strategy1.jpg"/> </p><p>the traditionally early states of iowa, new hampshire and south carolina will be very competitive. mayor (candidate last) leads his closest opponent in 5 out of the last 8 polls conducted in iowa. new hampshire polling finds just a few points separate the frontrunners. recent polls in south carolina have been mixed — a fox news poll (april 1-3, 2007) reports mayor (candidate last) leading all other (PARTY NAME)s. </p><p><strong>general election update</strong> </p><p><strong>(candidate full) will put california and other key battlegrounds in play</strong> </p><p>mayor (candidate last) has strong standing in early primary states like california. recent polls continue to support the idea that (candidate full) will help put not only california, but other key states in play during the general election. forty-four percent (44%) of (PARTY NAME)s, according to a recent pew<sup>2</sup> study, believe (candidate full) is the most electable candidate in the general election — a 23-point margin over the next closest (PARTY NAME) candidate. </p><p>mayor (candidate last) has the ability to win in california in both the primary and the general election. not since ronald reagan has a (PARTY NAME) candidate been in such a strong position to put california in play during the general election for the (PARTY NAME) party. </p><p>we are also pleased with our strength in the recent battlegrounds of florida and ohio. in addition, we are currently running strong in new jersey, pennsylvania and new hampshire — all states that president bush lost in 2004. </p><p><img align="bottom" alt="" border="0" hspace="0" src="http://www.joinrudy2008.com/photos/pr/5207strategy2.jpg"/> </p><p>we also plan on expanding the playing field to other recent (PARTY NAME) states in 2008. </p><p><strong>the (PARTY NAME) frontrunner beats the (PARTY NAME) frontrunner</strong> </p><p>while (PARTY NAME)s fare poorly in a generic ballot match-up, mayor (candidate last) is able to rise above it. (candidate full) may be the only (PARTY NAME) candidate that can compete in 2008 against the (PARTY NAME) nominee. mayor (candidate last) dramatically swings the gallup poll's generic ballot gap from a 15-point (PARTY NAME) deficit, to a 2-point lead over senator (candidate last) and a 9-point lead over senator (candidate last). since the beginning of february, (candidate full) has led (candidate full) in every major national poll conducted by an average of 4-points. </p><p><strong>strongest leader and most inspiring candidate</strong> </p><p>we believe this election is ultimately about leadership. (PARTY NAME)s are responding to mayor (candidate last)'s strength as a leader, confident in his ability to tackle the difficult challenges our country faces. </p><p>according to pew, mayor (candidate last) is seen as the strongest leader and the most inspiring candidate in the (PARTY NAME) field. thirty-seven percent (37%) of (PARTY NAME)s and (PARTY NAME)—leaning voters view (candidate full) as the strongest leader, and 44% find him to be the most inspiring candidate. more than any other elected office, voters choose presidents that can inspire and lead. </p><p>the same pew study also finds a plurality of (PARTY NAME)s believe (candidate full) is most likely to make the changes the country needs. </p><p><strong>(candidate full) has broad support</strong> </p><p>according to the pew study cited above, mayor (candidate last) leads all of his opponents for the (PARTY NAME) nomination in every major demographic and attitudinal measure — every age subgroup, every ideology subgroup, among men and women, every income cohort, among all religious subgroups (including white, evangelical protestants) and among both (PARTY NAME)s who approve of president bush's job performance and those who disapprove. </p><p>the gallup poll analysis also supports the breadth of (candidate last) support across ideology geography, age, education and gender. mayor (candidate last) also leads among regular church goers. </p><p><strong>conclusion</strong> </p><p>as the primary process develops, we are strongly positioned to capture the (PARTY NAME) nomination and we can maintain our strength through what will be an evolving and tightening (PARTY NAME) field. coming out of the nomination process we are confident we will enter the 2008 general election in the strongest position against any (PARTY NAME) nominee. </p><p>while we fully expect the polls to tighten and this to be a close race to the very end, this election is ultimately about leadership. </p><p>1 gallup poll — inside the (PARTY NAME) vote for president april 30, 2007 </p><p>2 pew research center — april 2007 political survey — april 18-22, 2007.</p></span>
