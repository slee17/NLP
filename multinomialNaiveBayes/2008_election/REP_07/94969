<span class="displaytext">today, the club for growth released its fourth presidential white paper on former new york city mayor (candidate full)'s economic record. <p>in new york city, (candidate full) governed a locality dominated by liberal (PARTY NAME); public-sector labor unions; social-welfare activists; and a powerful local news media actively hostile to a limited-government philosophy. in the face of such tremendous headwind, (candidate last)'s economic accomplishments are remarkable. </p><p>elected in 1993, on the heels of the largest annual tax increase in the city's history, (candidate last) inherited a city crippled by high taxes, ballooning deficits, and stalled job growth. despite these obstacles, mayor (candidate last) wasted no time in calling for $1 billion in tax cuts over the next four years, slashing city jobs, and cutting city-funded spending in real terms by more than $340 million. </p><p>[c]ity spending during (candidate last)'s eight years increased just barely, by an average of 2.84 percent — a remarkable number given the 2.9 percent population-plus-inflation benchmark. in addition, city spending as a percentage of gcp (gross city product) decreased from 10.9 percent to 9.3 percent — meaning, the size of government as a percentage of the economy actually decreased under (candidate last)'s tenure. </p><p>[g]iuliani's record on taxes and spending displays an intuitive appreciation for the vital role tax cuts play in growing the economy and a determination to cut the fat out of government. it is important to remember that gotham's economic revival was due, in large part, to (candidate last)'s determination to stimulate a stagnant economy by cutting taxes and spending, even in the face of fierce opposition. </p><p>(candidate last) demonstrated the same steely resolve and free-market mindset when it came to taking on new york city's welfare rolls and overbloated bureaucracy, and fighting for school choice. </p><p>in fact, welfare recipients under (candidate last)'s administration dropped from 1.1 million in 1994 to under 500,000 in 2001 — the lowest level in 35 years and a drop of more than 50 percent. </p><p>when it came to removing government's heavy handprint from the private sector, (candidate last) was just as merciless, privatizing many elements of new york city's bulky bureaucracy. … he sold many entities he felt the city had no business owning — why in the world did new york city own off-track betting facilities? — and turned over thousands of city-owned properties to private owners and developers. </p><p>and though (candidate last) began his mayoral career opposed to school choice, he soon became a passionate advocate for competition in the education market. though he was ultimately unsuccessful in forcing even a pilot school vouchers program on his liberal city council and education board, he certainly deserves credit for trying. </p><p>the most important question is what (candidate last)'s mayoral tenure tells us about how he would govern if elected president. … [o]ne cannot help but conclude that if (candidate last) could accomplish the pro-growth record he did in the hostile environment of new york city, the potential for him to accomplish even more amid the more politically balanced federal government is great. </p><p>to read the entire article, please <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ogvjnwi5yzdkntewnza3zmjmyjzmnwy5mmq5mzblnzg">click here</a>.</p></span>
