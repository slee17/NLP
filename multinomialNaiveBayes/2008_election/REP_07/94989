declared himself a candidate for the presidency. he ended this momentous day with an appearance on hannity and colmes. </p><p>since the mayor made his intention to run for president clear, we have seen notable growth in support for our campaign. before february, 5th, we were leading in major media polls by an average of 5-points. since february, 5th our lead has grown to an average of nearly 20-points. </p><p></p><table align="center" border="1" width="300"> <tbody> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff"> <td valign="top"><center><strong>lead in every major media polls over nearest (PARTY NAME)<br/>

acknowledge</strong><br/> many columnists and pundits question what will happen when (PARTY NAME)s "find out about the mayor's views on social issues." many of these stories are being generated by the same people that speculated that mayor (candidate last) would never run for president. over the course of the last month, that question has been dispelled. <p>a recent newsweek poll shows mayor (candidate last) with a 25-point lead among (PARTY NAME) and (PARTY NAME) leaning voters and a 30-point lead among social conservatives. mayor (candidate last) has a wider lead among social conservatives than he does among (PARTY NAME)s in general. social conservatives already know who (candidate full) is. in fact, more than 70% say they know "some or a lot" about him – these numbers are almost identical or better than other candidates in the race. </p><p>social conservatives are already more likely than (PARTY NAME)s in general to know the mayor's positions on key issues. social conservatives are tuned in to the campaign and they like what they see in mayor (candidate last). </p><p>according to recent analysis by gallup poll, mayor (candidate last) receives 47% of the votes among those that attend church "nearly weekly or monthly," leading his nearest opponent by 28-points. mayor (candidate last)'s ballot share decreases to 31% among those that "attended church weekly" – yet he maintains a 7-point lead over his nearest opponent. </p><p>after reviewing other data, i have found similar evidence. </p><p>about half of (PARTY NAME) primary voters consider themselves to be "very conservative." among those "very conservative" (PARTY NAME) voters, mayor (candidate last) generally maintains a lead. </p><p>another interesting point, about two-thirds of "very conservative" (PARTY NAME) primary voters consider mayor (candidate last) to be a moderate or a liberal. yet even with these voters, mayor (candidate last) holds a 5-point lead over his nearest competitor. </p><p>the fact is – most (PARTY NAME)s believe that mayor (candidate last) is a social moderate or liberal and mayor (candidate last) leads all major candidates in this race (even among "very conservative" (PARTY NAME)s). </p><p>there are, of course, some voters that will never vote for mayor (candidate last), and we know that we will see polls tighten. but the "when voters find out about rudy's record the sky will fall" notion is a myth. </p><p>rudy's positions and record are already known among most (PARTY NAME) primary voters and are factored in to the current polling. </p><p><strong>what we can expect</strong><br/> discrediting the commitment of the mayor to run for president did not work. telling (PARTY NAME)s that the mayor's positions on issues are unacceptable to primary voters does not work either. </p><p>as we have seen the next line of attack is aimed at discrediting the mayor's character. this attack – while not surprising – should be treated for what it is – cheap and political. </p><p>we expect polls to tighten as we move in to spring – such is the nature of the political process. while we are realistic about our expectations going forward, we are also pleased with where we are today and are confident our current support among (PARTY NAME) primary voters is strong. </p><p></p><hr align="left" width="70%"/> <p>gallup poll (1/12-1/14;
