<span class="displaytext">the (candidate full) presidential committee released the following statement from communications director katie levinson: <p>"as the pundits work to figure out who won the debate tonight, it's pretty clear (candidate full) was the real winner. it is increasingly apparent rudy is the one the (PARTY NAME) are most worried about running against in the general election. </p><p>"senator (candidate last)'s comments were of particular interest. the good senator is quite correct that there are many differences between rudy and him. for starters, rudy rarely reads prepared speeches and when he does he isn't prone to ripping off the text from others. and, senator (candidate last) certainly falls in to the bucket of those on the stage tonight who have never had executive experience and have never run anything. wait, i take that back, senator (candidate last) has never run anything but his mouth. </p><p>"such a desperate attack from senator (candidate last) is to be expected considering i – katie levinson – have a better chance of becoming president than he does."</p></span>
