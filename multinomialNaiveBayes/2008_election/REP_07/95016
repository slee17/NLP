<span class="displaytext">please see below the following statement regarding moveon.org's latest political attack: <p>"being attacked by the (PARTY NAME) character assassination machine moveon.org is something (candidate full) will wear as a badge of honor. this is, after all, the same liberal group whose website compared president bush to adolf hitler, the same liberal group that wanted no military response against the taliban in afghanistan in the aftermath of september 11th and the same liberal group that consistently opposes funding for our troops in the theater of war."</p></span>
