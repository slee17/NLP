<span class="displaytext">i express my condolences to his family, reverend falwell's family, and to his much larger family …he was a man who set a direction. he was someone who was not afraid to speak his mind. we all have great respect for him … he is a person who told you what he thought and you knew where he stood. … my sympathies and my prayers go out to his family."</span>
