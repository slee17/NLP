<span class="displaytext">mayor (candidate last) made the following statement on the law of the sea treaty today which the senate foreign relations committee will begin consideration of tomorrow: <p>"i oppose ratification of the law of the sea treaty. i believe the treaty is well intentioned, and i appreciate the hard work of u.s. negotiators who sought to resolve problems in the treaty first identified by president reagan. i also understand the arguments of those – particularly in our military – who claim that this treaty will enhance america's ability to guarantee freedom of the seas for all peace-loving nations. </p><p>"but i believe that the treaty is fundamentally flawed. i cannot support the creation of yet another unaccountable international bureaucracy that might infringe on american sovereignty and curtail america's freedoms. i oppose ratification of this treaty as long as it fails to address these concerns."</p></span>
