<span class="displaytext"><center><strong>(candidate last)'s opposition to tort reform keeps health care costs rising</strong></center> <p><strong>medical malpractice suits drive up doctors' costs, and this cost is passed on to consumer in higher health care costs.</strong> "today, many … doctors are afraid to practice medicine, or have begun to practice 'defensive medicine' to protect themselves against potential lawsuits. this fear factor alone has become an expected cost of doing business – a cost that is driving up medical malpractice premiums and what doctors charge for procedures. in the end, patients and consumers lose in the form of higher health-care costs and less access to care." (slade o'brien, "what 'sicko' says about us: movie misses the main point by ignoring abusive lawsuits," tallahassee [fl] (PARTY NAME), 7/25/07) </p><p><strong>medical malpractice suits also drive doctors out of practice.</strong> "in state civil justice systems that lack reasonable limits on liability, multi-million dollar jury awards and settlements in medical liability cases have forced many insurance companies to either leave the market or substantially raise costs. increasingly, physicians in these states are choosing to stop practicing medicine, abandon high-risk parts of their practices, or move their practices to other states."
