<span class="displaytext">mayor (candidate full) released the following statement on the passing of luciano pavarotti: <p>"i consider myself privileged to have been able to call so gifted a man as luciano pavarotti a personal friend. i join the music-loving world in mourning the loss of luciano pavarotti. he not only mastered the art of opera, he took it out of the opera house and brought it to the people of the world. throughout his career, he used his special gift to not only entertain and broaden musical horizons, but for humanitarian causes as well. he may be gone, but his voice and his art remain, and for that, we are extremely blessed." </p><p>"judith and i extend our sympathy and our prayers to his family and his friends."</p></span>
