<span class="displaytext">the (candidate full) presidential exploratory committee today announced that nearly 300 elected officials and key (PARTY NAME)s throughout new jersey have signed on to support mayor (candidate last). <p>george gilmore, the (PARTY NAME) chairman of ocean county, has been named new jersey chairman for rudy's campaign. "i support rudy because of his demonstrated leadership in crisis, his straightforward, no-nonsense approach to solving problems, and because i believe he'll win not only the majority of (PARTY NAME) votes but many independents and (PARTY NAME), as well. america's mayor ought to be america's president." </p><p>state senator tom kean, jr., will serve as honorary chairman. senator kean remarked, "during uncertain times, (candidate full) has proven to be a unifying force who leads with decisive action. even before september 11, 2001, america's mayor had transformed new york city's economy with fiscally responsible reforms. he helped me tremendously in my recent campaign for the united states senate and i will work hard to elect (candidate full) as the next president of the united states." </p><p>"mayor (candidate last) is honored by the overwhelming show of support from new jersey. people throughout new jersey saw firsthand the transformation that occurred in new york city under the mayor's leadership," said (candidate last) exploratory committee executive director mike duhaime, a new jerseyan himself. "the honorable men and women on this list come from every corner of the state and represent the breadth and diversity of the (PARTY NAME) party itself." </p><p>new jersey co-chairpersons of the campaign include former congressman bob franks, gop candidate for u.s. senate in 2000; state senator diane allen; roger bodman, executive director-nj of reagan/bush 1984; burlington county gop chairman col. mike warner; cape may county gop chairman david von savage; investment banker candace l. straight; president of wpi communications steve klinghoffer; and somerset county gop chairman dale florio. chairman florio summed up the feelings of many, stating, "somerset county lost many residents on september 11, 2001. mayor (candidate last) was our beacon of light then, and we think he is america's hope for the future." </p><p>the new jersey chairman's circle includes bergen county gop chairman guy talarico, morris county gop chairman john sette, sussex county gop chairman rich zeoli, bergen county gop chairman jose arango, and warren county gop chairman doug steinhardt. </p><p>burlington county (PARTY NAME) chairman col. michael warner remarked, "as a former prosecutor and mayor, (candidate full) has shown the type of leadership we need in the next president of the united states. he is tough on terrorism, knows how to grow and expand the economy, and will protect the homeland. i am proud to endorse the next president of the united states, (candidate full)." </p><p>cape may county (PARTY NAME) chairman david von savage said, "rudy is the only (PARTY NAME) who can carry new jersey and connecticut — two must-win states. the no. 1 issue in 2008 is the war on terror. rudy is the right man to lead and win the fight to preserve freedom and the american way." </p><p>investment banker candace l. straight observes, "mayor (candidate last) has proven that the tougher things get, the stronger he gets. our country is in need of his proven leadership, his ability to bring people together for a common good and his ability to make a difference when we need it most." </p><p>state senator anthony bucco put it this way, "the reason i am supporting rudy is because we need a strong leader with a proven record. he cleaned up the city and made people proud to say they are from new york." fellow senator nick asselta summed up the mayor's appeal saying: "(candidate full) has demonstrated the leadership skills that transcend ideological and partisan politics. he has proven his ability to handle crisis. in the war on terror, (candidate last) is the president america needs to make the tough decisions and lead our nation." senator diane allen put it succinctly, "no american has shown more effective leadership than mayor (candidate last)." </p><p>in a poll of new jersey voters taken by quinnipiac university, (candidate full) leads sen. (candidate full) 48 – 41 percent – remarkable for a state that hasn't voted for a republiscan presidential candidate since 1988. among registered (PARTY NAME)s in new jersey, (candidate last) collects 39% of the vote, compared to 21 for (candidate full), 11 for newt gingrich and 5 for (candidate full). </p><p>the full list of the first wave of new jersey supporters of (candidate full) follows, with
