<span class="displaytext">the (candidate full) presidential committee released the following statement today regarding the u.s. senate's rejection of the amendment put forth by senator vitter to the immigration legislation currently before congress: <p>"i commend senator vitter for his proposed amendment which echoed my call at the debate for making it mandatory that we identify every non-citizen who enters and exits this country. </p><p>"there is no guarantee in the current legislation that this will happen which is a fatal flaw. we need to be able to determine who is in this country which is why it is so important to have a uniform, tamper-proof, biometric identification card, a national database, and the us-visit system fully functional so we can track who is coming in and out of the country. </p><p>"it is unfortunate the senate defeated the amendment by one vote last night. i encourage the senate to reconsider their action."</p></span>
