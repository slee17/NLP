<span class="displaytext">mayor (candidate full) released the following statement on prime minister tony blair: <p>"like all americans, i was deeply moved by prime minister tony blair's strong support for america after 9/11. the people of new york and of america will forever remember how articulately and passionately mr. blair stood by america's side. i was fortunate to meet with him outside of st. thomas church at a memorial service for uk citizens who died on 9/11. it was clear then that the prime minister saw very real similarities between the war we are currently fighting and world war ii. </p><p>"i had occasion to visit with him several times in london and i could see then that while his approach may have been separated by generations and ideology, history will see mr. blair as a modern-day churchill. because they led through strength and fought for what is right, millions have been liberated, and the world is on a path to safety and prosperity. </p><p>"i am hopeful that the next prime minister will maintain the same level of friendship and cooperation with america, and the same level of resolute, principled engagement with the world."</p></span>
