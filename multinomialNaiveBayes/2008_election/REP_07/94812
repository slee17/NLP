<span class="displaytext"><em>yesterday, mayor (candidate last) announced the fedstat program. modeled after the successful compstat program used to turn new york city from the nation's crime capital into america's safest large city, fedstat can be used to vastly improve the performance of the federal government by measuring the success of each department in accomplishing its mission.<br/> </em> <p>"you've got to figure out what an agency is supposed to achieve, and then you have to figure out the measurement — the ultimate measurement of it — and then you have to figure out the measurements that come before it that predict it." — mayor (candidate full), press conference, 5/31/07 </p><p align="center"><strong>fedstat will make federal government accountable for success</strong> </p><p><strong>the american people are seeking accountability from government.</strong> "[t]he thing that i heard most often as i traveled around the united states over the last four or five years … was, 'washington doesn't work anymore. they don't seem to accomplish anything. they don't seem to be able to get anything done.' and that used to be the complaint about new york city." (mayor (candidate last), press conference, new york, ny, 5/31/07) </p><p><strong>fedstat can bring the accountability standards mayor (candidate last) applied in new york to washington.</strong> "now, this is what we should apply to the federal government, in order to satisfy the complaints and the criticisms of the people who say 'washington doesn't accomplish anything.' the concept must be — and if i were president, this is the way i would do it, and we're going to begin organizing it now, because we began organizing what we were going to do in new york city 18 months before — we've got to look at each one of the functions of the federal government and impose business-like standards on it, compstat standards on it."

(mayor (candidate last), press conference, new york, ny, 5/31/07) </p><p><strong>compstat's timely statistics, rapid deployment of resources and relentless follow up held government accountable.</strong> "if new york city were a business and therefore were accountable, how would you deal with it? and that led us in part to the compstat program. … this is what compstat is all about: accurate and timely intelligence, effective tactics, rapid deployment of personnel and resources, and relentless follow-up and assessment. the key to compstat is not only deciding what the measure of success is going to be, and measuring it every day on … [t]he key to it is relentless follow-up and assessment. having a compstat meeting every week. because very often in businesses or in governments all these statistics are created and people take them and they put them in their drawer, and six months later they look at the statistics. the innovation that compstat brought about was, it required everyone to confront the statistics every week." (mayor (candidate last), press conference, new york, ny, 5/31/07) </p><p><strong>other local, state and even national governments have found success with compstat-like programs.</strong> "[e]very place that has used these programs, including los angeles and many cities in the country and now some foreign countries have found them to be revolutionary in being able to turn governments into accountable, responsible organizations."

(mayor (candidate last), press conference, new york, ny, 5/31/07) </p><p><strong>terrorstat will help keep us safe from terrorist attacks.</strong> "you can take the compstat program and you can apply it to terror — terrorstat. it's a program that is … being developed in certain places in the country. it should be developed for the entire country, that is, trying to figure out what are the precursors that suggest that there's going to be a terrorist act, suspicious activity. … you need a system to make sure that we're getting all that information and we're getting the best use out of local law enforcement. … [t]he fbi is limited in resources. local police are unlimited in resources, hundreds of thousands. is it 700,000 local police? … they should be our eyes and ears with the fbi helping to coordinate that, work with that, working with them. a terrorstat program can get that intelligence to the right place." (mayor (candidate last), press conference, new york, ny, 5/31/07) </p><p><strong>gapstat — government accountability program stat — will impose fiscal discipline and reduce the size of government.</strong> "a gapstat program can help us measure whether we're actually imposing fiscal discipline on the government. it's my promise that i would reduce the size of the federal employees. … 42 percent of them are retiring in the next 10 years. my objective would be to try to replace about half those positions. no one would lose their job, but the position wouldn't get filled. we would replace those positions with technology or with figuring out how people can be more productive. well, you've got to track that. you have to have a gapstat program to track that, and to track the out-of-control expenditures in each one of the agencies."
