<span class="displaytext"><center><strong>cato institute rated (candidate last) "c" in 2006 for his tax policy</strong></center> <p>"as (candidate full) launches his bid for the (PARTY NAME) presidential nomination, his fiscal record as governor should be scrutinized. (candidate last) likes to advance the image of himself as a governor who has fought a liberal (PARTY NAME) legislature on various fronts … but (candidate last) will likely also be eager to push the message that he was a governor who stood by a no-new-taxes pledge. that's mostly a myth. his first budget included no general tax increases but did include a $500 million increase in various fees. he later proposed $140 in business tax hikes through the closing of "loopholes" in the tax code. he announced in may 2004 that he wanted to cut the top income tax rate from 5.3 to 5 percent, but that was hardly an audacious stand. voters had already passed a plan to do just that before (candidate last) even took office. in his budget for 2006, he proposed $170 million more in business tax hikes, almost completely neutralizing the proposed income tax cut. if you consider the massive costs to taxpayers that his universal health care plan will inflict once he's left office, (candidate last)'s tenure is clearly not a triumph of small-government activism."

[state revenue commissioner, alan] lebovidge said the two tax proposals are about fairness. the administration wants to sever the link for this one tax code change to prevent what it sees as the unintended consequence of lowering the income on which massachusetts can tax."
