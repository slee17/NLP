<span class="displaytext">the (candidate full) presidential committee released the following statement today from (candidate full) regarding the failed test vote on the immigration legislation before the united states senate: <p>"the american people demand that their politicians enact an immigration reform bill that addresses security first. i cannot support any immigration deal that compromises on this basic principle. </p><p>"this bill failed to guarantee a uniform, tamper-proof, biometric identification card, a single nation-wide database of foreigners in our country, and did not mandate the full implementation of a biometric check-in, check-out system. we can and must guarantee the american people that we know who is coming in and out of our country. </p><p>"as president, my administration will dedicate itself to assuring the american people that we have a secure border."</p></span>
