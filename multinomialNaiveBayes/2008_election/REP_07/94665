<span class="displaytext">mayor (candidate full) released the following statement on the president signing the united states-peru trade promotion agreement implementation act: <p>"the peru free trade agreement is an important step forward in our nation's effort to open up new markets for american exports. but this agreement is just one of the four free trade agreements (ftas) that have been submitted to congress. the remaining three ftas would also open new markets to u.s. companies and should be approved. congress should also immediately renew the president's trade promotion authority (tpa), so the u.s. can effectively negotiate and conclude other agreements that improve the standard of living for all americans. unfortunately, (PARTY NAME) leaders in congress have debated and repeatedly delayed votes on these agreements and have refused to grant the president tpa, placing partisan politics before the interests of american businesses and working families."</p></span>
