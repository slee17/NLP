<span class="displaytext">mayor (candidate full) made the following statement regarding judge leslie southwick's senate confirmation: <p>"today the senate did the right thing in confirming judge leslie southwick to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit. judge southwick is a man whose qualifications to be on the court of appeals — highlighted by distinguished service to the public and his country — are only exceeded by his respect for the constitution and the rule of law. all of the president's judicial nominees deserve the courtesy of timely consideration and an up or down vote by the united states senate. it is time for the senate (PARTY NAME) to get on with the business of confirming the president's other qualified nominees to the federal bench. as president, i will fight for meaningful and permanent legal reforms that will ensure that the president's judicial nominees receive timely consideration and an up or down vote."</p></span>
