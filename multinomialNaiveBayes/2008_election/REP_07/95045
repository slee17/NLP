<span class="displaytext"><strong>to: team rudy </strong> <p><strong>from: brent seaborn, strategy director </strong> </p><p><strong>re: 4th quarter kickoff </strong> </p><p><strong>date: october 2, 2007</strong> </p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p><p><strong>(PARTY NAME) primary field</strong> </p><p>the fourth quarter of 2007 will accelerate the (PARTY NAME) nomination process and begin to sort the race out even more. </p><p>mayor (candidate last) continues to lead all major media polls. a recent pew report poll1 reports mayor (candidate last)'s percentage of the ballot share has increased 5 points from the previous pew survey conducted in july2. the most recent pew survey also reports mayor (candidate last) leading the important (PARTY NAME) candidate attribute categories of "tough", "energetic" and "smart", among a handful of others3. a recent fox news poll4 reports mayor (candidate last)'s ballot support has increased 5 points from the previous fox news poll conducted in august5. </p><p>in addition to national polling, mayor (candidate last) is favorably positioned in a number of early and february 5 primary states. the mayor leads nearly all florida primary polls with a 2007 average of 30%, followed by (candidate last) 17%, (candidate last) 14% and (candidate last) 9%. mayor (candidate last) is consistently in 1st or 2nd place in south carolina public polling, essentially in a dead heat with former tennessee senator (candidate full). in addition, the mayor is running strong in iowa, solidly in second place and starting to close the gap behind governor (candidate last). (candidate last) was enjoying a clear advantage in new hampshire in mid-summer. however, mayor (candidate last) is now within a point or two of the first place spot in new hampshire, with a recent nh poll reporting the mayor and (candidate last) in a statistical tie for the top spot6. beyond the early states, mayor (candidate last) is the frontrunner in delegate-rich february 5 states such as california, illinois, new jersey and new york. </p><p>as it stands today, senator (candidate last)'s support in national public polling has recovered somewhat. his national average has increased about 5 points from his summer low of about 10% according to the real clear politics average. still, it seems that (candidate last) is capped at approximately 18% or 19% of (PARTY NAME) primary vote share as the field now stands. </p><p>voters responded to (candidate full)'s september entry into the gop primary race with a smaller-than-expected announcement bounce. typically an announcement will generate about a 10 point bounce. senator (candidate last)'s bounce ranged from zero points to 8 points, but averaged less than 4 points — certainly not what was expected for a campaign that spent so much time preparing to get in the race. </p><p></p><center> <table border="1"> <tbody> <tr bgcolor="#cccccc"> <td class="style5" width="63"><strong><center>date </center></strong></td> <td class="style5" width="87"><strong><center>(candidate last) </center></strong></td> <td class="style5" width="158"><strong><center>+/- from previous poll </center></strong></td> <td class="style5" width="179"><strong><center>survey </center></strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="style5">9/12-9/16</td> <td class="style5">21</td> <td class="style5">+3</td> <td class="style5">pew report</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="style5">9/10-9/12</td> <td class="style5">19</td> <td class="style5">no change</td> <td class="style5">ap/ipsos</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="style5">9/11-9/12</td> <td class="style5">22</td> <td class="style5">+8</td> <td class="style5">fox news</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="style5">9/7-9/10</td> <td class="style5">26</td> <td class="style5">+6</td> <td class="style5">nbc/wall street journal</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="style5">9/7-9/9</td> <td class="style5">27</td> <td class="style5">+5</td> <td class="style5">cnn</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="style5">9/4-9/9</td> <td class="style5">22</td> <td class="style5">+4</td> <td class="style5">cbs/new york times</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="style5">9/7-9/8</td> <td class="style5">22</td> <td class="style5">+3</td> <td class="style5">usa today/gallup poll</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="style5">9/4-9/7</td> <td class="style5">19</td> <td class="style5">+5</td> <td class="style5">abc news/washington post</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </center> <p>(candidate full)'s campaign spent more than $30 million during the first 2 quarters of 2007 and outspent others by $9 million or more. nationally, the (candidate last) campaign has spent $8 million on television and radio advertisements. and (candidate last)'s iowa straw poll victory had a likely price tag of more than $4 million. (candidate last)'s campaign has spent nearly $2 million on television in new hampshire and more than $1 million in south carolina and florida. in the 3rd quarter of 2007 alone, governor (candidate last) will have put more than $5 million of ads on the air. </p><p>in late august, governor (candidate last) enjoyed nearly a 20 point advantage in iowa; over the past month his lead over mayor (candidate last) has narrowed to an average of 10 points. late july and early august polling in new hampshire reported (candidate last) leading mayor (candidate last) by about 14 points. his new hampshire advantage has now narrowed to an average of only 4 points. </p><p>over the course of 2007, (candidate last) has averaged only 11% in south carolina. the (candidate last) campaign is preparing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on television in south carolina — we will have to see if south carolinians are receptive to his message. </p><p>michigan, one of (candidate full)'s home states, has recently moved their primary to mid-january. one recent public poll reports mayor (candidate last) leading the gop field with a 14 point advantage7, though others show a statistical dead heat. </p><p>senator (candidate last)'s resurgence has reshaped the race in florida somewhat; he and governor (candidate last) are now in a stiff competition for 3rd place in florida. here too, the (candidate last) campaign has been spending hundreds of thousands of dollars each week. </p><p>primary elections usually set up contrasts. an interesting component of the race is that no candidate has clearly positioned themselves as the social conservative alternative to (candidate full). (candidate full) entered the race expecting to take the position as the primary social conservative alternative to (candidate last), but (candidate full) has also impressed many primary voters and there is no clear social conservative favorite. </p><p>most notably, mayor (candidate last) continues to hold strong with socially conservative voters. socially conservative voters are becoming more comfortable with mayor (candidate last) as they hear him speak clearly about his agenda. two of the mayor's 12 commitments that are most important are "to increase the number of adoptions, reduce the number of abortions and protect the quality of life for our children." and no candidate has better credentials on judges and the mayor has committed to "reform the legal system and appoint strict constructionist judges." </p><p>a recent gallup poll report released last week points out that mayor (candidate last) leads among all (PARTY NAME) subgroups — including with conservative (PARTY NAME)s, those who attend church weekly, protestant/christians and catholics.8 </p><p><strong>2008 general election</strong> </p><p>president bush made news last week saying (candidate full) will likely be the (PARTY NAME) nominee — something the mayor has been acknowledging for some time. mayor (candidate last) is clearly the strongest candidate to run against senator (candidate last) in the general election and is likely the only (PARTY NAME) candidate that can beat her in 2008. </p><p>national polling head-to-head averages on real clear politics show mayor (candidate last) running approximately 8 points stronger than (candidate full) and about 5 points stronger than (candidate full) against (candidate last) in the general election. </p><p>in reviewing states with public polls testing hypothetical general election match-ups, mayor (candidate last) runs 6 to 7 points stronger than (candidate full) against (candidate full). in the most recent state general election polling, mayor (candidate last) beats (candidate full) in swing (PARTY NAME) states of arizona, colorado, missouri and nevada. </p><p>more importantly, the mayor puts blue states like connecticut, new jersey, wisconsin, california, oregon, pennsylvania and washington in play. pat toomey, president of the club for growth, states that "if (candidate last) wins the nomination, he would be a fascinating candidate in that he really re-draws the map." toomey points out that (candidate last) could carry new jersey, connecticut and pennsylvania '"so he changes the political calculus of the electoral college dramatically."9 and mayor (candidate last) may be the only (PARTY NAME) candidate that can now compete and win in ohio against (candidate full). </p><p>these states are critical, not only because rudy can win them, but if rudy is the nominee, (PARTY NAME) will be forced to spend money in california, new jersey, connecticut, pennsylvania, illinois, maryland, michigan, new york and washington — states that they have spent almost no money in over the last few election cycles. (candidate full) will be forced to advertise in new york city, los angeles and chicago — the 3 most expensive media markets in the country, something (PARTY NAME) haven't had to do in 20 years. this will effectively take florida off of the (PARTY NAME)'s target map — making it a safe (PARTY NAME) state in 2008 if mayor (candidate last) is the nominee. if another (PARTY NAME) is the nominee, traditional blue states will be safe, meaning the (PARTY NAME) can plow all their resources into ohio and florida. </p><p>in addition, if (PARTY NAME) have to spend money competing in connecticut and new jersey, they will have to buy new york city television. one week of new york city television will cost the (PARTY NAME) $3 million dollars, a week of time in los angles would cost $2.5 million and a week of television in chicago would cost $1.5. by forcing them to compete in "blue" states they will have fewer resources to spend in (PARTY NAME) leaning states like colorado, iowa, nevada and new mexico, reducing the number of "red" states (PARTY NAME) will compete in. </p><p>because of the mayor's ability to compete in all of these states and force the (PARTY NAME) to defend many states they have long considered "safe," mayor (candidate last) also gives our (PARTY NAME) congressional candidates in swing districts the best chance for winning, giving us our best chance at retaking the house in 2008. "a recent survey by (PARTY NAME) pollster celinda lake showed (candidate last) and (candidate last) trailing mayor (candidate last) in the 31 (PARTY NAME)-held house districts regarded as most imperiled in 2008, and even potentially serving as a drag on those lawmakers' reelection chances. it paints a 'sobering picture' for (PARTY NAME), according to a memo by lake and daniel gotoff that accompanies the poll report. (candidate last) takes 49 percent to (candidate last)'s 39 percent, while the former mayor's lead over (candidate last) is far smaller, 41 percent to 40 percent. 'despite (candidate last)'s relative advantage over (candidate last), both candidates are significantly underperforming against the generic (PARTY NAME) edge in the presidential and even against party identification,' lake and gotoff wrote."10 </p><p><strong>conclusion </strong> </p><p>as this race enters the home stretch, mayor (candidate last) continues lead every national poll while no single opponent has emerged to threaten his frontrunner status. by november, we will likely see which candidate pulls away from the rest of the second-tier and becomes the mayor's primary opposition. senator (candidate last) has rebounded from his summer lows but seems to have a limited potential for growth. (candidate full) has spent tens of millions of dollars, yet has failed to become a significant player on the national stage. and we have yet to see if (candidate full) will try to compete as a regional or a national candidate. </p><p>as the moveon attacks on the mayor demonstrate, there is no candidate that (candidate full) and the (PARTY NAME) fear more in the general election than (candidate full). that strength is further supported by recent poll numbers showing mayor (candidate last) as the (PARTY NAME)'s strongest general election candidate and reiterated by (PARTY NAME) polling in swing (PARTY NAME) congressional districts. </p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------— <br/> 1 pew report national poll – 9/12/07-9/16/07; rwg 32%, (candidate last) 21%, (candidate last) 9%, (candidate last) 15.<br/> 2 pew report national poll – 7/25/07-7/29/07; rwg 27%, (candidate last) 18%, (candidate last) 10%, (candidate last) 16%.<br/> 3 pew report national poll – 9/12/07-9/16/07; "tough": rwg 39%, (candidate last) 18%, (candidate last) 26%, (candidate last) 2%.<br/> "energetic": rwg 48%, (candidate last) 8%, (candidate last) 11%, (candidate last) 14%.
