<span class="displaytext">to america's firefighters: <p>no american will ever forget the terrorist attacks of september 11th. as a firefighter, i know the courage and sacrifice the firefighters and first responders showed that day to rescue our friends and loved ones. i also greatly respect the leadership by our public officials. one of those people was mayor (candidate full). </p><p>there is no one who respects firefighters and first responders more than (candidate full). that's why i was deeply disappointed and disheartened to learn of the recent partisan political activities by the international association of firefighters (iaff). </p><p>those of us who have worked with him know that (candidate full) has always been a steadfast and unrelenting supporter of firefighters and first responders. the iaff's accusations in its "draft letter," which made its way into the hands of the media, flies in the face of the facts. it is offensive and inaccurate. </p><p>firefighters have no greater friend and supporter than (candidate full) and i am proud to join thousands of firefighters across the country in supporting him. </p><p>sincerely, </p><p>lee ielpi<br/> fdny, retired</p></span>
