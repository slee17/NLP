<span class="displaytext"><b> <u> in february 1995, (candidate last) supported revising the gop abortion plank to let states decide their own abortion laws. <br/> </u> </b> <br/> "the issue divides strongly committed pro-life and pro-choice (PARTY NAME)s but is not a central issue to most other (PARTY NAME)s. a possible platform revision long under discussion would say the (PARTY NAME) party, 'unlike the (PARTY NAME) party, does not stand for abortion on demand and is basically a pro-life party.' in the spirit of federalism, the proposed gop revision also would replace the abortion amendment with a statement saying the issue should be left up to the individual state legislatures to deal with as each sees fit. '<b><i>that's exactly what we have looked for, and if it's left up to the states, more of them are going to put some restrictions on abortion,' arkansas lt. gov. (candidate full) said in an interview after app earing on a conference panel yesterday."</i></b> (ralph z. hallow, "conservatives hold fire on abortion," washington times, 2/12/95) <p><b> <u> and in an april 2006 interview with the blog "right wing news" (candidate last) indicated that abortion decisions should be left to the states.<br/> </u> </b> <br/> <b> <i>john hawkins [right wing news]:</i> </b> switching gears again, do you think we should overturn roe v. wade? </p><p><b><i>(candidate full):</i></b> it would please me because i think roe v. wade is based on a real stretch of constitutional application -- that somehow there is a greater privacy issue in the abortion concern -- than there is a human life issue -- and that the federal government should be making that decision as opposed to states making that decision. so, i've never felt that it was a legitimate manner in which to address this and, first of all, <b><i>it should b e left to the states, the 10th amendment</i></b>, but secondly, to somehow believe that the taking of an innocent, unborn human life is about privacy and not about that unborn life is ludicrous.
