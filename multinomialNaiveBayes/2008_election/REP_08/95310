<span class="displaytext">mclean, va -(candidate last) for president communications director todd harris today released the following statement on reports of push polling phone calls being made in iowa, new hampshire and south carolina: <p>"there is no room for this kind of smut in a (PARTY NAME) primary election. while there are certainly issues our campaigns disagree on, we are united by far more than that which divides us. one of our candidates is going to emerge from this process as the standard bearer for all (PARTY NAME)s, and we will need a united party to win next year. this kind of robo-dial bigotry which tears down (PARTY NAME)s today will only serve to prop up (PARTY NAME) tomorrow. it has to end and end now."</p></span>
