<span class="displaytext"><b> mclean, va </b> - (candidate full) today issued the follow statement: <p>"tonight we expect president george w. bush will tell the nation that success in iraq is achievable and that, conditions on the ground permitting, up to 30,000 troops will be coming home by next summer. i am encouraged by reports by general david petraeus and ambassador ryan crocker that the security situation is improving and momentum is on our side. </p><p>"i believe that the troop withdrawal plan that general petraeus has proposed is the right course. this recommendation is a result of the success being seen on the ground in iraq. </p><p>"with the momentum of an effective military strategy now on our side, we must press forward, never wavering, and unite in our determination to defeat al qaeda and other extremists who remain committed to forcing our surrender. this is central not only to success in iraq, but also to our long-term plan to bring our troops home. </p><p>"a wholesale withdrawal of american troops from iraq--as many (PARTY NAME) propose -- would embolden al qaeda, strengthen iran, betray our allies, and dishonor the memories of the men and women who have sacrificed so much to keep us safe. </p><p>"gen. petraeus' report also leaves me even more concerned about iran's role in iraq. iran is headed down a dangerous path, and president mahmoud ahmadinejad must understand that. </p><p>"every day, our troops in iraq demonstrate a heroic resolve to win. i wish (PARTY NAME) in washington would dedicate as much time and energy to winning as they do on how to surrender the fight. the average 20 year-old serving in iraq apparently knows more about national security than many of the 20 year-political veterans serving in congress."</p></span>
