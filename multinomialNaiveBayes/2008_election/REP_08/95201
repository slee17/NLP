<span class="displaytext"><b> mclean, va </b> - senator (candidate full) issued the following statement today regarding iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad's appearance this afternoon at columbia university: <p>"columbia university gave a public forum today to a tyrant to spread his lies and deceit. mahmoud ahmadinejad made a mockery of free speech by standing in front of an auditorium of academicians and students and denying the existence of the holocaust and his deadly intentions toward israel. </p><p>"i find it ironic that iran's president accepted an invitation to speak at columbia university, since students who dissent on iranian campuses are not met with debate, they are met by a gun and imprisonment. a few months ago, eight college students were imprisoned in iran's notorious evin prison for publishing articles and cartoons critical of iran's government in a student-run newspaper. the evin facility has been described as iran's 'most feared prison' and is known to stone women to death. we need to do our best to empower freedom-loving people throughout iran."</p></span>
