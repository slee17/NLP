<span class="displaytext">[<i>below is an excerpt from his remarks as prepared for delivery:</i>] <p>"the tax code, with its length and hopeless complexity, is indicative of the entire federal government. in 2001, when i was chairman of the government affairs committee, i published a two-volume report on departments and agencies rife with overlap, duplication, waste, and lack of accountability. we found $20 billion in waste. it is not getting better. we have computers that do not talk to each other, and departments that cannot pass an audit. every department needs a top-to-bottom review with a strict cost-benefit analysis applied to every program."</p><p>...</p><p>"there has been no greater friend to the american taxpayer than (candidate full), and there will be no greater friend than a (candidate full) administration. i ran as a consistent, tax-cutting, small government conservative. i supported all three major tax cuts put before me in the senate. as chairman of the government affairs committee, i sought to save the american taxpayer $20 billion in wasteful spending. the bush tax cuts must be made permanent, and we must cut government spending. i am the only consistent, pro-growth conservative in the race. </p><p>"while i was fighting for tax cuts in congress, others were opposing tax cuts in new york state. others were claiming not to be raising taxes but were instead raising every state-mandated fee and imposing 'hidden taxes' on unsuspecting taxpayers. while others were repudiating reagan-bush tax policies, i was fighting for them."</p></span>
