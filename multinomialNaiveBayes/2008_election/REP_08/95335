<span class="displaytext">mclean, va - senator (candidate full) issued the following statement today regarding congress's decision to extend the internet tax ban: <p>"american taxpayers are hit with enough taxes, state-mandated 'fees' and 'surcharges' whether on the state or local level. that's why congress did the right thing last night by agreeing to extend the ban on consumers' internet access taxes. broadband is the technology that is revolutionizing the way people communicate, learn, manage their finances, and even receive health care. it's integral to our ability to compete in the global marketplace. now isn't the time to kill a golden goose that will help our nation's future prosperity and that's what new taxes on internet and broadband would do."</p></span>
