(chuck todd, nbc first read, 12/12) </p><p>"winner: (candidate full). good substance, good personality, and his i won't raise my hand for an answer question reminded me of reagan say 'i paid for this microphone.' fred definitely won." (right wing news, 12/12) </p><p>"he had the sharpest tone and sounded like a leader" (nbc first read, 12/12) </p><p>"this guy looks like he could eat most of the rest of the field for lunch." (jim geraghty, nro, 12/12) </p><p>"seriously, it's like (candidate last) came to the debate in des moines today to do two things: kick butt and chew gum. and it appears he's all out of gum." (mark hemingway, nro, 12/12) </p><p>"(candidate full) is easily having his best debate; the format suits him well; it's very issue oriented and doesn't allow for too many back-n-forths and gives fred a chance to shine."

(rich lowry, nro, 12/12) </p><p>"(candidate last) is sounding like he's decided this debate's format stinks, and so he's going to protest by mocking the mockery it has become. it's the most life he's shown in a while."

(jim geraghty, nro, 12/12) </p><p>"asked for a show of hands on global warming, (candidate last) finally stands up. 'i'm not doing any hand shows today.' a few folks applaud. fred: you gonna give me a minute to answer it? moderator: no. fred: then i'm not gonna answer it. this gets a smattering of applause. and yup, i'm applauding at home."
