<span class="displaytext">to: interested members of the media<br/>from: karen hanretty, deputy communications director<br/>date: 12/13/2007<br/>re: (candidate full) campaign apologies <p>in light of (candidate full)'s heartfelt apology to (candidate full) for making reference to (candidate last)'s religion in the new york times magazine, we at the (candidate last) campaign would like to offer (candidate last) our own heartfelt apologies for some references we've made about his record as governor of arkansas. </p><p><b> we apologize for pointing out that as governor of arkansas, (candidate last) offered in-state tuition to illegal immigrants. that's something he'd probably just as soon no one talk about. </b> </p><blockquote dir="ltr"> <p>a recent washington post-abc news iowa poll of iowans likely to vote in the (PARTY NAME) caucus stated illegal immigration as their top issue of concern, tied with the war in iraq.( <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/polls/postpoll_112007.html"> <i> http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/polls/postpoll_112007.html </i> </a> <i> ) </i> </p></blockquote> <p><b> we apologize for pointing out that in 2002 (candidate last) wrote pres. bush a letter asking him to lift the cuban embargo. it's easy to see how (candidate last) might have missed the finer points of a 40-year embargo. while he obviously knew enough about the embargo to ask that it be lifted, (candidate last) clearly didn't know enough to ask that it not be lifted. so for that, we're sorry. </b> </p><blockquote dir="ltr"> <p>in 2002, governor (candidate last) strongly advocated lifting the embargo against cuba saying it "harm[s] our own agricultural and business interests," "has not helped the people of cuba" and has "provided castro with a convenient excuse for his own failed system of government." (<i>arkansas (PARTY NAME)-gazette, 3/29/02</i>) </p></blockquote> <p><b> we apologize for referencing that 47% tax increase (candidate last) imposed on arkansas taxpayers when he was governor. that must be really awkward for him, now that he's running in a gop primary election. we notice he never points it out to voters. </b> </p><blockquote dir="ltr"> <p>average arkansan's tax burden increased by over 47% between 1997 and 2005 (or $933 per person). (<i>arkansas (PARTY NAME) gazette, 10/9/07</i>) </p></blockquote> <p><b> we apologize for telling reporters that a ba in biblical studies from ouachita baptist university doesn't, in fact, make (candidate last) more qualified to fight the war on terror than say...(candidate full). </b> </p><blockquote dir="ltr"> <p>in an interview with cbnnews in november, (candidate last) said "...i truly understand the nature of the war that we are in with islamo fascism. these are people that want to kill us. ... and i don't know if anybody fully understands that. i'm the only guy on that stage with a theology degree."
