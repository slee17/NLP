<span class="displaytext"><b> mclean, va </b> - senator (candidate full) issued the following statement today on ratification of the law of the sea treaty: <p>"i oppose the ratification of the law of the sea treaty at this time. the treaty threatens u.s. sovereignty and gives a u.n.-affiliated organization far too much authority over u.s. interests in international waters. the american people also deserve ironclad assurances that the problems with the treaty highlighted by president reagan more than two decades ago have been fixed. at a time when customary international law in this area has proven sufficient, i believe the efforts of treaty proponents would be better spent reforming the united nations. until such reforms are complete, i see little reason for the u.s. to move forward on the law of the sea treaty."</p></span>
