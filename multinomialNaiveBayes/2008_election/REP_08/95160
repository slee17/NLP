(chapter 58 section 3 (q) section 16m (a), <a href="http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/seslaw06/sl060058.htm"> http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/seslaw06/sl060058.htm </a> ) </p><p><b> (2) provides taxpayer-funded abortions </b> . abortions are covered in the commonwealth care program that (candidate last) created as governor. under the program, abortions are available for a copay of $50.
