<span class="displaytext"><i> excerpts from: "flat tax fred" </i> <i> <br/> <i> by the editorial board </i> <br/> <i> the wall street journal </i> <br/> <i> november 28, 2007 </i> </i> <p>"...late last week [senator (candidate full)] unveiled a tax reform that is more ambitious than anything we've seen so far from the rest of the gop field.</p><p>"mr. (candidate last) wants to abolish the death tax and the alternative minimum tax and cut the corporate income tax rate to 27% from 35%. but his really big idea is a voluntary flat tax that would give every american the option of ditching the current code in favor of filing a simple tax return with two tax rates of 10% and 25%.<br/>...</p><p>"liberals are already objecting that the plan is not "paid for," by which they mean it doesn't raise taxes the way they hope the next president will. but mr. (candidate last) is right in refusing to play by the "static revenue" scoring game that demands that one dollar in estimated tax cuts be offset by one dollar in estimated t ax increases somewhere else. "the experts always overrate the revenue losses from tax cuts," mr. (candidate last) says, and history supports him going back to the mellon reductions of the 1920s, the kennedy tax cuts of the 1960s, the gipper's in the 1980s, and this decade's success with president bush's reductions.</p><p>...</p><p>"however, what's refreshing about the (candidate last) plan is that it goes well beyond the current (PARTY NAME) mantra to make "the bush tax cuts permanent." that is certainly needed, but the gop also needs a more ambitious agenda, especially with economic growth slowing. the flat tax has the added political benefit of assaulting the special interests who populate the gucci gulch outside congress's tax-writing committee rooms. lower rates and simplify the tax code, and you instantly reduce the opportunities for beltway corruption. it is both a tax policy and political reform.</p><p>"the two apparent (PARTY NAME) front runners, (candidate full) and (candidate full), should be paying attention. both have called for tax cuts in general but have dodged any endorsement of the flat tax -- presumably because they think it is too politically risky. the politically calculating mr. (candidate last) has questioned whether the flat tax is "fair." mr. (candidate last) is more open to the idea, saying the flat tax "would be a lot easier. it would probably bring in a lot more revenue and it would not have some of the burdens on the economy that the massive tax code has." that's right, so why not go all the way?</p><p>"mr. (candidate last)'s voluntary proposal is one way to deflect some of the inevitable political opposition. anyone who prefers the current tax code can stick with it. the rest of us can have a better choice. <i> to view the entire editorial, please visit: </i> <i> <br/> <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110010918">http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110010918</a> </i></p></span>
