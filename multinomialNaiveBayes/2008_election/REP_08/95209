<span class="displaytext"><b> mclean, va </b> - (candidate full) today issued the follow statement on judge mukasey, president bush's nominee for attorney general: <p>"the president appears to have nominated someone whose career experience qualifies him to serve as attorney general. i hope that senate (PARTY NAME) will move promptly on judge mukasey's nomination, as the department of justice needs a senate-confirmed leader to address the significant challenges we face as a nation. judge mukasey will need to prove himself an attorney general with a firm commitment to confronting the global terrorist threat, both here and abroad, while also ensuring the protection of our basic liberties. his recent op-ed on the subject in the wall street journal is a good sign that he has that commitment. i also hope that as soon a s he is confirmed he will take a fresh look at whether the fbi has successfully transformed itself to focus on preventing rather than responding to terrorist attacks."</p></span>
