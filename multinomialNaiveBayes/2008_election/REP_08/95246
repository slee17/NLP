<span class="displaytext"><b> mclean, va </b> - sen. (candidate full) released the following statement today in response to a ruling by the u.s. court of appeals for the 8th circuit - americans united for separation of church and state v. prison fellowship - regarding an important first amendment ruling on religious programming in prisons. <p>"the 8th circuit court of appeals opinion appears to allow prison fellowship's privately funded, voluntary prisoner rehabilitation programs in iowa's prisons to continue. prison inmates face daunting odds: statistically, two-thirds of them will be rearrested within three years of their release. as a society, we must do something to reduce this number and help returning inmates break the cycle of crime. prison fellowship's program has already demonstrated great promise. this ruling will allow faith-based prison programming to continue in order to improve the odds of successful reentry into society. this decision represents a win for the state of iowa, for prison fellowship, and for anyone concerned about reducing recidivism."</p></span>
