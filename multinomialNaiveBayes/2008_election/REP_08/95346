<span class="displaytext">mclean, va - here's an exchange from last night's debate that may have slipped your notice... <p>the <i>los angeles times</i> reports: "former sen. (candidate full) of tennessee set the tone by saying rival rudolph w. (candidate last) believes in federal funding for abortion and 'sanctuary cities' for illegal immigrants." </p><p>... </p><p>"as for sanctuary cities, (candidate last) defended his policy, saying it enabled 'illegal immigrants to report crime and to put their children in school.'" </p><p>conservative (PARTY NAME)s who opposed the (candidate last)-kennedy immigration reform bill earlier this year would be shocked to learn that (candidate full) not only supported sanctuary cities and ignored the problem of illegal immigration while he was mayor of new york city but he actively advocated for more rights on behalf of illegal immigrants.</p></span>
