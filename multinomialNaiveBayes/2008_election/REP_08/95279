(it was temporary until revenues improved. the legislature repealed it in 2005.) </p><p>- increased the sales tax by 1/8 of one percent by initiated act (but it was a personal campaign by (candidate last), who campaigned across the state for it and took a celebrated bass boat trip for 4 days down the arkansas river holding press conferences in each river city to urge passage of the act) </p><p>- increased the sales tax by one-half of 1 percent (act 1492 of 1999) </p><p>- increased the sales tax by 7/8ths of 1 percent and expand the sales tax to many services previously exempt from the tax (act 107, 2nd special session of 2003) </p><p>- collected a 2 percent tax on chewing tobacco, cigars, package tobacco, cigarette papers and snuff (act 434 of 1997) </p><p>- levied an additional excise tax of 7 percent on tobacco (act 38 of 1st special session of 2003) </p><p>... </p><p>- increased the tax on cigarettes by 25 cents a pack (act 38, 1st special session of 2003) </p><p>... </p><p>- increased the tax on gasoline by 3 cents a gallon (act 1028 of 1999) </p><p>- increased the tax on diesel by 4 cents a gallon (act 1028 of 1999) note: contrary to what (candidate last) has said repeatedly in debates, speeches and tv shows, the 1999 gasoline and diesel taxes were not submitted to the voters and approved by 80 per cent of them. it was never submitted to a vote. it was the governor's bill and it became law without a vote of the people. what the voters did approve in 1999 was a bond issue for interstate highway reconstruction but it did not involve a tax increase. existing taxes and federal receipts were pledged to retire the bonds. </p><p>- increased the driver's license by $6 a person, from $14 to $20 (act 1500 of 2001) </p><p>so which raised taxes more? it is hard to quantify. if you measured the increases in the revenue stream, the (candidate last) tax cuts far exceeded (candidate last)'s but that would be unfair because the economy had grown and the same penny of tax would produce far more under (candidate last). </p><p>but if you look at the major taxes, i see the aggregate (candidate last) taxes as greater, especially if you deduct the 4 cent gasoline and diesel taxes that (candidate last) vetoed in 1985 and that the legislature enacted over his veto. </p><p>anyway, the sales tax is the big revenue producer. both raised it by 1.5 cents on the dollar and both expanded it to cover a myriad of services. (candidate last) raised motor fuel taxes a little more, (candidate last) cigarette taxes a lot more. </p><p>a further note: (candidate last) claims credit for a major tax cut in 1997, saying it was the first tax cut in arkansas history (there had been many prior to that) and that he forced the (PARTY NAME) legislature to curtail its impulse to always raise taxes. </p><p>the facts: the omnibus income tax cut bill of 1997 was proposed by gov. jim guy tucker in the spring of 1996. it had multiple (7) features, all aimed at relief for middle-class families or the elderly. he asked interim legislative committees to expand on his plan. tucker then resigned before the legislature convened after his conviction on whitewater-related charges, and (candidate last) took office. </p><p>at the legislative session that followed, the (PARTY NAME) caucus of the house (88 of the 100 members) made the tucker tax cuts its chief program. the bill was introduced with 83 sponsors (all (PARTY NAME)) and all (PARTY NAME) voted for it. it was unopposed. (candidate last)'s tax cut was to give each taxpayer a check for $25 each fall, saying it would help offset the burden of sales taxes on groceries (the repeal of which he repeatedly opposed). the legislature rejected (candidate last)'s plan and passed the tucker bill. (candidate last) signed it into law. </p><p>the 94 tax cuts that he said he fathered are similarly misleading. the vast majority of those were the usual exemptions and modifications of various taxes and fees that the legislature enacts every time it meets. they were not a part of (candidate last)'s program with a few exceptions. rather, (PARTY NAME) legislators sponsored them, usually at the behest of whatever special interest benefited, and (candidate last) signed them when they hit his desk. if you did a similar summary of (candidate last)'s years he could claim probably well over 100 tax cuts. every arkansas governor since world war ii could claim dozens each. </p><p>if you counted all the tax benefits extended to corporations under the incentives enacted by the legislature under (candidate last) -- and they were part of his programs, especially in 1983, 1985 and 1989 -- the tax cuts would dwarf those under (candidate last). </p><p><i> to view the entire piece, please visit </i> <i> : </i> </p><p><a href="https://mail.fred08.com/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?url=http://www.arkansasleader.com/2007/11/editorialswhos-biggest-tax-raiser.html" target="_blank"> http://www.arkansasleader.com/2007/11/editorialswhos-biggest-tax-raiser.html </a></p></span>
