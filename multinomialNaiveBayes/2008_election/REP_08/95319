<span class="displaytext"><b> mclean, va </b> - (candidate last) for president communications director todd harris today released the following statement in response to the outrageous accusations by the (candidate last) campaign and its supporters in today's <i>washington times</i> that the national right to life committee was bribed by the (candidate last) campaign in exchange for its endorsement: <p>"gov. (candidate last) is new to the pro-life movement and his campaign clearly has a few things to learn about it. first, they should understand that despite their campaign's every effort, groups like the national right to life committee's pac (nrlc-pac) cannot be bought. nrlc-pac is supporting (candidate full) because of fred's 100% pro-life voting record. they know he stood with them yesterday, he stands with them today, and he will stand with them tomorrow. it is unseemly for the (candidate last) campaign and its supporters to suggest that nrlc-pac's coveted endorsement is based on a bribe. second, this unfounded accusation is as outrageou s as it is ironic, given the (candidate last) campaign's long history of spreading money around to anyone who will take it. </p><p>"if the (candidate last) campaign is looking for the reason they did not receive the nrlc-pac endorsement, they can start with the fact that gov. (candidate last) was pro-choice just two years ago. they should also consider the fact that gov. (candidate last)'s own health care plan in massachusetts offers taxpayer funded abortions for a mere $50 co-pay and requires by law that a representative from planned parenthood sit on the masshealth advisory board. tellingly, gov. (candidate last) made no such requirement for a representative from the pro-life movement. </p><p>"the (candidate last) campaign was clearly hoping for this endorsement and are now clearly upset. but being denied an endorsement is no excuse to impugn the integrity of the very organization they were just days ago trying to woo." </p><p><b> (chapter 6a: section 16m) masshealth payment policy advisory board; composition; powers and duties; staff </b> </p><p>section 16m. (a) there shall be a masshealth payment policy advisory board. the board shall consist of the secretary of health and human services or his designee, who shall serve as chair, the commissioner of health care financing and policy, and 12 other members: 1 member appointed by the speaker of the house; 1 member appointed by the president of the senate; 1 member appointed by the massachusetts hospital association; 1 member appointed by the massachusetts medical society; 1 member appointed by the massachusetts extended care federation; 1 member appointed by mass aging services association, 1 member appointed by the home care alliance of massachusetts; 1 member appointed by the massachusetts league of communi ty health centers; 1 member appointed by mental health and substance abuse corporations of massachusetts; 1 member appointed by the massachusetts medicaid policy institute; 1 member appointed by the massachusetts association of behavioral health systems; <b><u>1 member appointed by planned parenthood league of massachusetts</u></b>; and 2 members appointed by the governor, 1 member representing managed care organizations contracting with masshealth and 1 member being an expert in medical payment methodologies from a foundation or academic institution. </p><p>link to full law<b> (chapter 58 of the acts of 2006, an act providing access to affordable, quality, accountable health care)</b> </p><p><a href="http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/seslaw06/sl060058.htm">http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/seslaw06/sl060058.htm</a></p></span>
