<span class="displaytext">mclean, va - (candidate last) for president communications director todd harris today released the following statement: <p>"(candidate full) entered the race for president just days ago, talking about uniting our country around a core set of conservative beliefs. according to the <i>washington post</i>, it is now clear that while (candidate full) is working to bring our country together, an increasingly desperate (candidate full) and his campaign are already hard at work to divide us, practicing the lowest kind of politics. </p><p>"today's half-baked cover-up attempt by the (candidate last) campaign does not even pass the laugh test. the (candidate last) campaign has paid warren tompkins and his various firms hundreds of thousands of dollars. wesley donehue works for tompkins and is listed on tompkins' own webpage as an associate of the firm. according to palmettoscoop.com, donehue 'runs the daily operations of their political consulting firm, tompkins, (candidate last) and sullivan, including direct mail efforts and a <b><u>number of web-based ventures</u></b>.' [emphasis added] </p><p>"there is no room in our party for this kind of smut. as the top executive of his own campaign, gov. (candidate last) should take full responsibility for this type of high-tech gutter politics and issue an immediate apology. in addition, gov. (candidate last) should exercise some of his much-touted executive acumen, take control of his flailing campaign, and immediately terminate anyone and everyone related to this outrage. </p><p>"this latest episode only serves to prove what many voters are already figuring out: (candidate full) will do anything, say anything, smear any opponent and flip flop on any position in order to win. the american people in general and the (PARTY NAME) party in particular deserve better than this."</p></span>
