<span class="displaytext"><center><i> on the heels of (candidate last)'s dominant debate performance, reagan's newspaper of choice says for conservatives "the answer is (candidate full)" </i> <p><i> "human events endorses (candidate full)" </i><br/> <i>the editors</i> <br/> <i>human events</i> <br/> <i>january 11, 2008</i></p></center> <p>...</p><p>we begin by recalling the profound words of ronald reagan at the conservative political action conference feb. 15, 1975: "a political party cannot be all things to all people. it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromis ed to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers." we believed that then, and we believe it now. the issue for us -- and for the conservative community -- boils down to which of the candidates is most representative of the fundamental conservative principles we believe in. the answer is (candidate full).</p><p>...</p><p>we conclude that (candidate last) is a solid conservative whose judgment is grounded in our principles.</p><p>in his senate years, mr. (candidate last) compiled an american conservative union lifetime rating of 86.1, which is higher than both sen. (candidate full) (82.3) and rep. ron paul (82.3). the club for growth has praised (candidate last) as someone who has a strong commitment to limited government, free enterprise and federalist principles. </p><p>on the issues that matter most to conservatives, sen. (candidate last)'s positions benefit from their clarity. he is solidly pro-life. he sai d that he was in favor overturning roe v. wade because it was "bad law and bad medical science." as the national right to life committee said in its endorsement of him nov. 13, 2007, "the majority of this country is opposed to the vast majority of abortions, and (candidate full) has shown in his consistent pro-life voting record in the u.s. senate that he is part of the pro-life majority."</p><p>(candidate last)'s record is solid on voting to preserve gun owners' rights, cut taxes, reduce government spending and drill for oil in alaska's arctic national wildlife refuge. he has voted consistently against gay marriage. </p><p>...</p><p>we like the way (candidate last) unhesitatingly attacks the liberal ideologues and their activists such as moveon.org and the aclu, and the way he reaches out to those we knew as the reagan (PARTY NAME). </p><p>the question now is whether sen. (candidate last) will do what he has not yet done: take the advantages he is given by his intelligence, his principles, his polit ical skills and this endorsement and make the best use of them. </p><p>as the primaries and debates speed by, we would like to see sen. (candidate last) continue to invigorate his campaign to carry him successfully through tsunami tuesday and to nomination at the (PARTY NAME) convention. </p><p>sen. (candidate last), you suffer, like most conservatives, from the built-in problem of not being a professional politician. it's precisely as rush limbaugh said of you: "the problem with (candidate last) is, and a little bit with me, is i'm a depth guy. i like depth. television doesn't reward depth. television rewards zingers, one-liners, cutesyisms. (candidate full) produced a brilliant 17-minute video that was on youtube that explains everything about every issue that he cares about. it's clear he's thought deeply about a whole lot." </p><p>...</p><p>for example, your stand on reforming th e entitlement programs that threaten to bankrupt our nation is courageous and workable.</p><p>... </p><p>we agree with rush limbaugh's characterization of your december 30 video speech to iowa voters. more speeches like that one and an ad campaign demonstrating the reaganesque inspiring optimism we know you have could create a momentum in south carolina that would carry far beyond its borders.</p><p>... </p><p><i> to view the whole editorial please visit </i> <i> : </i> </p><p><a href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=24398"> http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=24398 </a></p></span>
