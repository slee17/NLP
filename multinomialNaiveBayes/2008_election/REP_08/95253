<span class="displaytext"><b>washington, d.c.</b> - former senator (candidate full) pointed out the continuing strength of the u.s. economy in a commentary posted on his newly redesigned web site: www.imwithfred.com. <p>"the economic reality i'm talking about, and about which i've written on numerous occasions, is how well our country is doing economically thanks to the hard work of the american people, the innovation and competition our free market encourages, as well as the bush tax cuts that helped spur 5 1/2 years of economic growth," said (candidate last). </p><p>the commentary noted more than 8 million jobs have been created, unemployment and inflation remain at historically low levels, and workers' salaries have risen by $1.2 trillion over the last three years. </p><p>"no matter how you slice this story, this economic record is one we should be proud of," (candidate last) noted. "but america should not rest on these accomplishments, or abandon fiscal restraint and other commonsense principles like fighting inflation and keeping regulation to a minimum. our economy looks great right now, but a rosy outlook isn't going to pay the bills or ensure a strong economy. </p><p>"we need to make sure that america remains the most innovative economy in the world and the best place to invest, start a business, and create jobs."</p></span>
