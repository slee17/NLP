(candidate last) has said he opposes gay marriages, but he has stopped short of supporting a constitutional ban. instead, he has said he would back a federalist approach in the form of a constitutional amendment that would let a state refuse to recognize same-sex marriage ceremonies performed in other states. </i> </p><p><i> (candidate last) spokesman jeff sadosky said in an e-mail that mr. (candidate last), who served as senator from 1994 to early 2003, "has a 100 percent pro-life voting record and on issues such as life and marriage, he believes strongly in returning authority to the levels of government closest to families and communities and protecting states from further intrusion by the federal government and activist judges." </i> </p><p><i> mr. perkins said the (candidate last) proposal would stop "judges from redefining marriage or one state imposing same-sex marriage on another state." </i> </p><p><i> ... </i> </p><p><i> he said mr.
