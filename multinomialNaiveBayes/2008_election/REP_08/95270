"(candidate full) as a candidate received a respectable b grade rating from the nra, and when he was governor he had the support of the nra and the gun owners action league in relaxing some of the state's burdensome licensing regulations." </p><p>what madden didn't say was that (candidate last)'s (PARTY NAME) opponent in the governor's race, shannon o'brien, was given a more than respectable "a" grade by the nra, according to its website. </p><p>the issue of guns has repeatedly dogged (candidate last), who as a u.s. senate candidate in 1996 was in favor of several gun control measures. earlier this year, (candidate last) was mocked for saying that he was a "small varmint" hunter. </p><p><i> to view the article please visit </i> <i> : </i> </p><p><a href="https://mail.fred08.com/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2007/12/16/(candidate last)_claims_nra_endorsement.html%23more" target="_blank"> http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2007/12/16/(candidate last)_claims_nra_endorsement.html#more </a></p></span>
