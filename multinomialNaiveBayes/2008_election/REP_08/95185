<span class="displaytext"><b> harris faulkner </b> : senator, your reaction, first, to the assassination of benazir bhutto. <p><b> (candidate full) </b> : it is a tragedy, of course. it reminds us that things can happen in faraway places of the world that can affect the united states. i think this should be of great concern to us. it is almost a perfect storm in a very bad sense because two forces are operating against each other that are both desirable. one is democracy: they were making progress in that regard in that country. former prime minister bhutto was an important part of that process. but the other is stability. pakistan is a nuclear country, and we cannot afford to let nukes fall into the hands of dangerous muslim radicals. we are hoping those two things can be balanced out. we can see the continued progress toward a (PARTY NAME) society but also maintain stability in the country, which seems to be very much in doubt right now. </p><p><b> faulkner: </b> i know you are running for the white house, so i don't want to put you in a position to second guess the president. but i'm interested in your opinion. president bush is due to talk with pervez musharraf shortly. what do you anticipate that conversation should be like? </p><p><b> (candidate last): </b> those two things that i mention probably would be high on the agenda. what could be done to not impose martial law, to not crack down, but be mindful of the fact that there are radical elements in that country, and perhaps even within the government, that would like to see instability and chaos and see those weapons fall into the wrong hands. this is part of a bigger problem. we need to understand that this is not a criminal investigation any more - so we find the bad guys and bring them to justice - it's a war. </p><p>this proves again the mindset of the radical elements that we are dealing with. we are seeing this all across northern africa and various places. we're seeing it across the middle east and in parts of asia including indonesia and other places. we have to come to terms with that and do the things necessary to prevail. one of the things we need to be talking about is what musharraf can do, additionally, to crack down on the taliban. i think they have been insufficient in that respect. </p><p><b> faulkner </b> : taliban also supporters of al qaeda in that country. pakistan has been an important ally in the war on terror, so have do you walk that line? </p><p><b> (candidate last): </b> you just walk it. no one said it has been easy and simple. pakistan has never been easy or simple. i had a chance a few years ago to talk to musharraf before things got quite as complex as they are now. but it has always been an important part of the world. they're next door to india. they've had a crisis after crisis with regard to them. they're next door to afghanistan, and they're important to us. they've been helpful to us. but we' re going to have to walk that line between democracy on the one hand and stability on the other. but i think it's possible.</p></span>
