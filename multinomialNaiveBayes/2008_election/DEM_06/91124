<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement about ann coulter's recent comments saying that a newsweek poll showing senator (candidate last) leading (PARTY NAME) candidates was made up and might help al qaeda. <p>"just when we thought ann coulter couldn't take the politics of personal destruction any lower, she proved us wrong. her outrageous comments are inexcusable and should not be tolerated in the public dialogue. </p><p>"this is the latest example of how the political doctrine of bush's global war on terror has created a climate where people think it's okay to use the threat of terrorism as a guise for hateful political attacks. there is no superior '(PARTY NAME)' way to fight terrorism. the exercise of raw power alone does not make you a world leader, and will not make us secure. our capacity to lead requires that we be strong - and that we have the moral authority to do it."</p></span>
