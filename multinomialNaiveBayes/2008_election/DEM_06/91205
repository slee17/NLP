<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement today criticizing president bush's veto of the stem cell research enhancement act. <p>"president bush had a simple choice today: direct the full force of american scientific ingenuity towards responsible, life-saving medical research or pander to a narrow segment of his political base. with his veto, he made the wrong choice, pushing medical breakthroughs that could help millions of americans further away. we need a president who will embrace science-driven policy, rather than politically-biased science."</p></span>
