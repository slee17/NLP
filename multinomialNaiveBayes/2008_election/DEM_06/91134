<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement following president bush's veto of the iraq funding bill. <p>"today, president bush vetoed a bill that supports our troops and ends the war in iraq that he declared won four years ago. </p><p>"four years ago he flew onto the deck of the u.s.s. lincoln under a 'mission accomplished' banner to declare victory in iraq. today, all the photo ops in the world can't hide the truth - the war is still raging, and the president's mismanagement of iraq is still dead wrong. our troops have done everything they were asked and deserve a hero's welcome. instead, they remain in harm's way; iraq has become a breeding ground for terrorists; and we're no closer to a permanent political solution than we were four years ago. </p><p>"but one thing has changed: the american people have given congress a mission to end the war - but that mission hasn't been accomplished yet. </p><p>"congress needs to stand firm and strong. congress should answer the president's veto by sending him another bill with a timetable for withdrawal. and if he vetoes that one, congress should send him another and another until we end this war and bring our troops home. </p><p>"there is no military solution to the conflict in iraq - only a political solution. the iraqi people need to take responsibility for their own country. under my plan, we would cap funding at 100,000 troops to stop the (candidate last) doctrine of escalation and force an immediate withdrawal of 40-50,000 troops, followed by a complete withdrawal in 12-18 months. now is not the time for political calculation, it is the time for political courage. every person who is against this war needs to speak out, so together we can bring an end to the quagmire that is iraq."</p></span>
