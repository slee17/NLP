<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – senator (candidate full) released the following statement: <p>"we will never forget the tragedy that occurred on this day six years ago when the hijackers crashed their terrible ideology into the american dream. nearly 3,000 americans died on that heartbreaking day in new york city, in arlington, virginia, and in shanksville, pennsylvania. they were bankers and waiters, secretaries and firefighters, they were family and friends, and they were our fellow americans. </p><p>"while the profound grief we still feel in this moment of remembrance will stay with us forever, we also find hope in the courage and compassion of those we lost. their sacrifice is a harsh and lasting reminder of what has become one of the great goals of our generation—to keep america safe and to root out terrorism from the face of the earth. </p><p>"now, six years later, we must gain further strength from the sacrifices paid on 9/11. as we look forward, in the face of growing threats, americans must remain vigilant in our fight against terrorism, and seek a new path that unites like-minded nations in a global mission to shut down terrorism once and for all. </p><p>"we have overcome great foes in the past. i have faith that through the same courage and strength displayed by the heroes of 9/11, we will do so again."</p></span>
