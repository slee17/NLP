[epi, 2006; census, 2007; dol, 2007] </p><h4> universal health care </h4> <p>forty-seven million americans live without health insurance. all of us struggle with the skyrocketing costs and inconsistent quality of care in our health care system – a system that fails to ensure that even insured americans get the care they need. (candidate last) will create a true universal health care system that covers everyone in america, brings down costs, and creates more choices and security. </p><h4> good jobs </h4> <p>approximately 25 million jobs are at risk of moving offshore within the next decades, according to the economic policy institute. (candidate last) will invest in the good jobs of the future by creating a new energy economy based on clean, renewable energy, rejecting failed trade deals in favor of new smarter trade policies, and eliminating tax incentives for corporations to invest overseas. </p><h4> excellent schools </h4> <p>america still has two school systems that are separate and unequal. every year 200,000 qualified students cannot afford college. (candidate last) will invest in teachers with higher pay and a new national teachers university, overhaul no child left behind, and invest more to turn around struggling schools. his college for everyone initiative will let everyone work their way through college. </p><h4> affordable housing </h4> <p>affordable housing in safe neighborhoods near good schools and good jobs is a key to opportunity. homeownership is a cornerstone of the american dream and helps families build wealth and security. (candidate last) will help families save for a downpayment with a new get ahead tax credit, create 1 million housing vouchers to let families live where they choose, build more economically integrated housing. </p><h4> strong families </h4> <p>two-third of mothers now work, but american workplace policies are badly outdated. the u.s. is one of only five countries in the world without paid maternity leave. (candidate last) will work with states to offer eight weeks of paid leave to new parents and workers with serious illnesses in the family. he will also create a universal great promise program of early childhood education and more than double the child care tax credit.</p></span>
