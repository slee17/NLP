<span class="displaytext"><b>las vegas, nevada</b> – during a "get out the caucus" rally in las vegas today, (candidate full) made the following statement calling on senator (candidate last) to denounce the unite here radio ads. <p>"just a few days ago, on a stage where all three of us were participating in the debate, there was a discussion of putting behind us and stopping the race politics that had been going on for a few days before that between senator (candidate last) and senator (candidate last). and everyone pledged that this kind of divisive politics that divides the (PARTY NAME) party and could divide america would come to an end. </p><p>"senator (candidate last) made that pledge. i was sitting five feet from him when i heard him say it. and now it turns out that in the last twenty-four hours, there's a radio ad that's being run—a malicious radio ad attacking senator (candidate last). that is exactly that kind of divisive politics. it's being run right here in las vegas. </p><p>"i denounce it. this kind of ad, i don't care who's doing it—in this case it's senator (candidate last)'s supporters—but this sort of thing needs to stop. and from what i've seen, senator (candidate last) has not said a single word about this. nothing...when two days ago, three days ago, he sat on a stage in front of america and said this kind of politics had no place in america. that is divides america. it divides the (PARTY NAME) party. and he denounced it. well, now it's happening...by his supporters...right here in this campaign twenty-four hours before the caucuses. and what i have to say is he should speak up. if he really means what he says—and this is not just talk—he should speak up and denounce this kind of divisive politics. it is not what the (PARTY NAME) party needs. it is not what america needs. and let me say this very clearly, vis-a-vis senator (candidate last), i will not divide america. i will unite america."</p></span>
