<span class="displaytext">we are simply heartbroken by the deaths and injuries suffered at virginia tech. we know what an unspeakable, life-changing moment this is for these families and how, in this moment, it is hard to feel anything but overwhelming grief, much less the love and support around you. but the love and support is there. we pray that these families, these students, and the entire virginia tech community know that they are being embraced by a nation. there is a methodist hymn that gave us solace in such a moment as this, and we repeat its final verse here, in hopes it will help these families, as it helped us: <blockquote> <p>in our end is our beginning; in our time, infinity;<br/> in our doubt there is believing, in our life, eternity,<br/> in our death, a resurrection; at the last, a victory,<br/> unrevealed until its season, something god alone can see. </p></blockquote> <p>our dearest wish is that this day could start again, with the promise of these young people alive. knowing that cannot be, our prayer is for god's grace and whatever measure of peace can be reached on this terrible day. </p><p>john and elizabeth (candidate last)</p></span>
