<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – today, (candidate full) for president communications director chris kofinis released the following statement in response to the attack on senator (candidate last) in tonight's gop debate by governor (candidate full): <p>"in the debate tonight, governor (candidate last) was caught being deceptive about his own record. he is also being deceptive about whether there are two americas – one for the most powerful and one for everyone else. news flash, governor: the 98% of americans who were not born to great wealth or who have not been given special privilege in our country struggle every day to make ends meet and provide opportunities for their families. no small part of their struggle is because the game has been rigged to protect those on top. it is not surprising governor (candidate last) proposes additional policies to assist the crowd on easy street. unfortunately for him, the millions of americans who live and work on main street know much more about the reality of where we are as a country."</p></span>
