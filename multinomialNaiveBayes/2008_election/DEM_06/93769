"i grew up in small, rural towns and my parents didn't have a lot of money. but i was lucky to have people who taught me to believe that somebody from seneca could do just about anything if he worked hard and played by the rules. </p><p>"in the america i believe in, every child deserves to have the same chances i had. i was the first in my family to go to college and i think that every young person who is willing to work hard has the opportunity to go to college and fulfill the american dream." </p><p>at the forum, (candidate last) outlined his plan to make college more affordable for millions of students through a national college for everyone program that will pay for public college for students willing to take a part-time job. the college for everyone program is based on a proposal that (candidate last) first talked about in his 2004 presidential campaign. in the fall of 2005, (candidate last) helped start a college for everyone pilot program at greene central high school in snow hill, north carolina, a economically disadvantaged, rural community in eastern north carolina. the projected college-going rate for greene central seniors has increased from 54 percent before the program started to 74 percent today. </p><p>before the forum, (candidate last) presided over the official opening of the new oconee county (PARTY NAME) party headquarters in seneca. later in the day, (candidate last) will stop by the haven restaurant in charleston before headlining the charleston county (PARTY NAME) women holiday party accompanied by actor harry belafonte. </p><p>to date, (candidate last) leads all (PARTY NAME) candidates in campaign stops and money raised in south carolina. earlier this month, (candidate last) became the first (PARTY NAME) candidate to launch television ads in the state. the campaign has aired three south carolina ads so far. during "building a better america" week, (candidate last) is highlighting five core proposals to build a better america including universal health care, good jobs, excellent schools, affordable housing, and strong families. (candidate last) has challenged the american people to rise up and meet the great moral test of our time to ensure our generation leaves this country better for our children than it was when our parents gave it to us. </p><p>for more information on (candidate last)' plan for making college affordable, please see the policy document included below. </p><hr/> <h2 align="center">college affordability through college for everyone</h2> <blockquote> <p>"in america, every child should be able to go as far as his god-given talents and hard work will take him. as the first in my family to go to college, i know that our system of public education should be our sturdiest ladder of opportunity." – (candidate full) </p></blockquote> <p>college has never been more important. college graduates can expect to earn $1 million more over their lifetimes than high school graduates, and their children are almost twice as likely to attend college themselves. however, an estimated 200,000 college-qualified graduates fail to attend college each year. students from high-income families are five times more likely to enroll in college than their low-income peers. students who do go to college now leave with about $20,000 in debt. last year, student debt rose by 8 percent while college graduates' starting wages grew by only 4 percent. [census, 2002; advisory committee on student financial assistance, 2002; nels, 1998; project on student debt, 2007] </p><p>today, (candidate full) proposed a series of initiatives to help all qualified students pay for college. his college opportunity agenda includes: </p><p><b>creating a national "college for everyone" initiative:</b> (candidate last) will create a national initiative -- based on the greene county program -- to pay one year of public-college tuition, fees, and books for more than 2 million students. in return, students will be required to work part-time in college, take a college-prep curriculum in high school, and stay out of trouble. </p><ul><li><b>lower costs:</b> research has shown that reducing the price of college can increase college enrollment rates, particularly in the first year of college. unlike existing student aid programs, which give more money to schools with higher tuition, college for everyone will encourage states and colleges to keep tuition low. state budget cuts are the number-one driver of higher tuition. [dynarski, 1999; nces, 2004]</li> <li><b>clear eligibility:</b> many high school students and parents assume they cannot afford college, overestimating tuition and overlooking student aid. college for everyone's universal eligibility for qualifying students would break through the noise of the current student aid system and send a strong message that all qualified students can afford college. [ace, 1998] </li> <li><b>strong preparation:</b> too many students don't go to college -- or fail once they get there -- because they were not adequately prepared in high school. the number one determinant of success in college is the rigor of high school courses. college for everyone students will be required to complete a college-prep curriculum in high school. (candidate last) will also work with school districts to strengthen high school curricula. [department of education, 1999]</li> </ul> <p><b>overhauling the student loan program:</b> banks that make student loans receive large federal subsidies and a guarantee against default. however, millions of students have borrowed directly from the u.s. department of education, receiving loans that have very similar terms but are far less expensive for taxpayers. (candidate last) will let all students borrow directly from the department of education. by eliminating bank subsidies on student loans, he will free up billions of dollars to make college more affordable. </p><p><b>simplifying financial aid:</b> the application for student aid, known as the fafsa, is needlessly complicated and longer than many tax forms. many students and families need classes to help fill it out, and 1.5 million high school students do not apply for aid even though they are eligible. (candidate last) would dramatically simplify the application process by using information the federal government already has, eliminating two-thirds of the questions. [ticas, 2007] </p><p><b>giving students the tools they need to apply for college and aid:</b> financial aid alone is not enough. too many students lack the encouragement and guidance they need to apply to college. in some large cities, a single counselor must serve more than 700 students. (candidate last) will help every low-income high school eligible for title i hire a new college counselor, helping students choose college-track courses and navigate the admissions and financial aid process.
