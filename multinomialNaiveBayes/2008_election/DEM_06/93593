<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ (candidate full) for president national campaign manager congressman david bonior released the following statement in response to former mayor (candidate full)'s comments that he was at ground zero in new york city "as often, if not more" than rescue workers. <p>"evidently, (candidate full) has taken a break from reality. it is outrageous for (candidate last) to suggest, in any way, shape or form, that he did more at ground zero or spent more time there than the brave first responders who worked tirelessly around the clock for many months during the rescue and recovery operation. it seems that (candidate last) is determined to take every opportunity to exploit the memory of 9/11 for political gain, rather than honor the incredible sacrifices of our first responders. enough is enough. </p><p>"mayor (candidate last) should start answering the serious questions of why firefighters and other first responders didn't have proper equipment and support. the 9/11 commission and national institute of standards &amp; technology reports have documented the failures of the broken radio communications system, a splintered chain of command and an unprepared office of emergency management under his watch as mayor. these are the questions he needs to answer."</p></span>
