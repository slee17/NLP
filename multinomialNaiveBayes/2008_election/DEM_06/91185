<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement regarding senator (candidate full)'s speech today on the war in iraq. <p>"(candidate full) said today that we should seek the "judgment of history" rather than the "small politics of the day." but the people playing politics with iraq are senator (candidate last) and president bush, and they should be ashamed of themselves. </p><p>"(candidate last) and bush are brazenly trying to claim that congress is failing to provide our soldiers the resources they need. nothing could be further from the truth. congress funded the troops. if the president vetoes that funding, he's the only one responsible for blocking funding for the troops. and (candidate full) knows that. </p><p>"i have urged congress to stand up to the president's veto threat, rather than back down in a false game of chicken. if he does veto funding for our troops, congress should send the same bill right back to him. and they should do this again and again, until the president finally understands that he cannot reject the will of the overwhelming majority american people. </p><p>"we must end the conflict in iraq, and force the iraqis and their neighbors to find a political solution to the conflict. the plan i announced months ago would cap funding at 100,000 troops to stop the (candidate last) doctrine of escalation and force an immediate withdrawal of 40-50,000 troops followed by a complete withdrawal in 12-18 months. under my plan, complete withdrawal is not just a goal" it is a requirement backed by congress' funding power."</p></span>
