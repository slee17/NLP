<span class="displaytext"><h4>releases new policy book, entitled "plan to build one america," outlining his bold vision for the country</h4> <p><b>des moines, iowa</b> – today, senator (candidate full) delivered a major thematic speech in which he called upon americans to honor the sacrifice of the millions of veterans in the generations of americans that came before us by rising up to meet the great moral test of our generation – ensuring that our children have a better, more prosperous life than we've had. (candidate last)' speech comes on the heels of a rousing performance at the iowa (PARTY NAME) party's jefferson jackson dinner, as well as the launch of his first television ad in iowa and the endorsement of the 10,000 iowa-caucus-goer strong caucus for priorities. </p><p>"for twenty generations, americans have kept the one moral commandment that makes us american – to pass a better future on to our children than we received," said (candidate last). "but everywhere i travel today – in every corner of america – i hear uncertainty – a real concern that we could be the first generation of americans that fails to leave our children a better future than our parents left us." </p><p>(candidate last) continued: "to be the first generation of americans to fail that commandment would be an abomination. this is the great moral test of our generation – to ensure that we give our children a better future than we inherited, just as our parents did for us." </p><p>in keeping with his commitment to make sure his positions are clear, (candidate last) also unveiled an 80-page "plan to build one america" book (<a href="/issues/plan-to-build-one-america.pdf">download pdf</a>) laying out his policy proposals on a wide range of issues. over the next few weeks, the campaign will deliver more than 100,000 copies of the book to iowa caucus-goers. it will also be available to download from the campaign website at <a href="/issues/plan-to-build-one-america.pdf">john(candidate last).com/issues/plan-to-build-one-america.pdf</a>. </p><p>"over the course of the last year, i have offered detailed, honest plans and specific, forthright proposals," said (candidate last). "but i don't want anyone in iowa to have to take my word for it, so i've gone and put them all on paper. iowans have a right to know where i stand and what i'll do as president. you are the guardians of what kind of president we'll have, and whether america meets the great challenges we face. i'm not afraid to stand here and answer your questions, and i want you to have all the facts." </p><p>(candidate last)' policy proposals focus on four core principles: first, standing up for working and middle class families and passing universal health care; second, restoring america's moral leadership around the world and ending the war in iraq; third, investing in a better future for our children by improving schools, making college affordable and stopping global warming; and fourth, creating opportunity for all. </p><p>(candidate last) has dedicated his campaign to standing up for hard-working americans who have no voice in washington. and his campaign continues to gain strength in iowa. last month, (candidate last) reached an important milestone as he became the first candidate to visit – and answer questions from iowans – in all 99 counties. (candidate last) is the first candidate in the race to announce steering committees in all 99 iowa counties. and he is the only candidate with both county chairs and rural county chairs in every county.
