<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ today, (candidate full) for president communications director chris kofinis released the following statement: <p>"today, senator (candidate last) made it crystal clear where she stands: she defends health care for politicians while millions of americans and their families go without care. </p><p>"voters have a clear choice between (candidate full), who will fight to finally pass universal health care, and senator (candidate last), who seems intent on defending the washington establishment. </p><p>"when (candidate full) is president, he will name names and the american people will know which members of congress are taking the money of big insurance company lobbyists and voting against universal health care while protecting their own health care. and unlike what happened in 1993, (candidate full) will never kill legislation to give health care to ordinary people while letting the politicians keep their coverage."</p></span>
