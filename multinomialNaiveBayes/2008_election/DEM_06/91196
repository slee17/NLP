<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – today senator (candidate full) released the following statement: <p>"i am both astonished and horrified at reports that the pentagon is sending injured soldiers who have not completed their tours of duty bills for portions of their signing bonuses. </p><p>"this administration has already underserved our service men and women through scandals like walter reed, relentless deployments and the extension of tours to a grueling 15 months. but the practices outlined in this report are even more reprehensible. </p><p>"as president, i will make sure our injured veterans receive our gratitude and our support – not a bill from the government. throughout this campaign, i have proposed bold policies to restore our sacred contract with our veterans and military families, from guaranteeing health care to fixing the disgraceful backlog in disability claims at the va to providing a comprehensive plan for victims of post-traumatic stress disorder. i call on congress to force george bush to change this terrible practice and allow injured soldiers to keep their signing bonuses. during a week when we give thanks, these brave men and women deserve no less for their heroism and their service to our nation."</p></span>
