<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – following today's report in the <i>new york times</i> that congress may cave on a withdrawal date from iraq, sen. (candidate full) released the following statement: <p>"in 2006, the american people elected a (PARTY NAME) congress to change course and end this war. it's the whole reason the american people voted for change. yet, 10 months after the election, we still have the status quo and congress has still failed to do the people's will. that might be the way they do it inside the beltway, but it's not the american way. it's time to stand up for the american people and against president bush's failed, stubborn policy. without a firm deadline, a small withdrawal of only some of the surge troops won't cut it—that's not a solution, it's an excuse. congress must not send president bush any funding bill without a timeline to end this war. no timeline, no funding. no excuses."</p></span>
