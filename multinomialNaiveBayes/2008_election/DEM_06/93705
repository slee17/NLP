<span class="displaytext"><h4>(PARTY NAME) leaders in georgia explain why (candidate last)' strength at the top of the ticket will motivate swing voters, helping (PARTY NAME) maintain and expand their majority in congress and win in down-ballot races in georgia and across the nation</h4> <p><b>atlanta, georgia</b> – as part of a new "true blue majority" campaign launching this week, today georgia (PARTY NAME) leaders held a press conference to announce their support of (candidate full) for president. </p><p>"it is so important that we nominate a candidate who will motivate swing voters in battleground states, like georgia, to support the (PARTY NAME) party in 2008," said former governor roy barnes. "poll after poll in red and battleground states shows (candidate last) to be the strongest (PARTY NAME) challenger in a general election match-up with the leading (PARTY NAME)s. (candidate last)' strength at the top of the ticket will help (PARTY NAME) not only to take back the white house, but also to maintain and expand our majorities in congress and state legislatures. and his coattails will help lead (PARTY NAME) to victory in down-ballot races at the state and local level as well." </p><p>"we need a leader who can compete anywhere in america, and win," added barnes. "some pundits say that a (PARTY NAME) can't win in some places in the south, midwest or west. but they're wrong. the right (PARTY NAME) presidential nominee – one who shares our values, understands our issues and offers real and bold solutions – can win these states. that candidate is (candidate full)." </p><p>"the american people are tired of being ignored by the folks in washington. the people who want real change in this nation don't just live in blue states or in swing states – they live in every state in this country and on every street in america," said (candidate last). "i am committed to spreading a message of real change in every single state in this country. as the (PARTY NAME) nominee, i will go to small towns in georgia that politicians usually ignore and i will work to get (PARTY NAME) elected to congress, governorships and state legislatures all across this country." </p><p>the following georgia leaders have endorsed (candidate full) for president: </p><ul> <li>former governor <strong>roy barnes</strong></li> <li>former lt. governor <strong>mark taylor</strong></li> <li>former georgia congressman<strong> ben "cooter" jones</strong></li> <li>state senate (PARTY NAME) leader <strong>robert brown</strong></li> <li>state house (PARTY NAME) leader <strong>dubose porter</strong></li> <li>state senator<strong> vincent d. fort</strong></li> <li>state senator <strong>valencia seay</strong></li> <li>state senator <strong>steve henson</strong></li> <li>state representative and chief deputy whip <strong>rob teilhet</strong></li> <li>state representative <strong>stephanie stuckey benfield</strong></li> <li>state representative <strong>michele henson</strong></li> <li>state representative <strong>gerald greene</strong></li> <li>state representative <strong>jeannette jamieson</strong></li> <li>state representative <strong>charles jenkins</strong></li> <li>state representative <strong>billy mitchell</strong></li> <li>state representative <strong>hugh floyd</strong></li> <li>state representative <strong>wade starr</strong></li> <li>former state senator and middle georgia attorney <strong>michael moore</strong></li> <li>former state senator <strong>mel traylor</strong></li> <li>former state representative; former chairman of the polk county party, <strong>john moore</strong></li> <li>former state representative <strong>tom bordeaux</strong></li> <li>former judge of the georgia court of appeals <strong>marion t. pope</strong></li> <li>kerry chair and kerry-(candidate last) chair in georgia, former chair of (PARTY NAME) party in georgia <strong>david worley</strong></li> <li>former dnc executive committee member; former national president, college (PARTY NAME) of america, <strong>ashley bell</strong></li> <li>middle georgia attorney <strong>chuck byrd</strong></li> <li>macon city councilman, <strong>mike cranford</strong></li> <li>macon city councilman, <strong>rick hutto</strong></li> <li>macon city council elect. macon attorney and (PARTY NAME) activist <strong>lauren logan benedict</strong></li> <li>former taylor county sheriff; past president of the georgia sheriff association, <strong>nick giles</strong></li> <li>atlanta attorney and former chief of staff to senate (PARTY NAME) caucus <strong>amol naik</strong></li> <li>former executive director of the georgia (PARTY NAME) party <strong>jeff disantis</strong></li> <li>former communications director of the georgia (PARTY NAME) party <strong>emil runge</strong></li> <li>atlanta business leader <strong>shi shailendra</strong></li> <li>associate director for the conflict resolution program; son of president jimmy carter, <strong>jeff carter</strong></li> <li>attorney <strong>stephen leeds</strong></li> <li>former commissioner of macon-bibb county planning and zoning, founding member of women's political network, founder and former editor of macon magazine <strong>joni woolf</strong></li> <li>former bibb county school board member, <strong>terry tripp</strong></li> <li>co-founding chair of the georgia win list , <strong>melita easters</strong></li> <li>coordinator for georgia women for kerry (candidate last) in 2004, <strong>amy morton</strong></li> <li>founder and president of nannies + more , <strong>sacha taylor</strong></li> <li>atlanta attorney; (PARTY NAME) fundraiser and activist , <strong>fred orr</strong></li> <li>atlanta attorney; (PARTY NAME) fundraiser and activist , <strong>martin chitwood</strong></li> <li>atlanta attorney; (PARTY NAME) fundraiser and activist ,<strong>tim morrison</strong></li> <li>atlanta attorney; (PARTY NAME) fundraiser and activist , <strong>tim santelli</strong></li> <li>columbus attorney; (PARTY NAME) fundraiser and activist, <strong>james butler</strong></li> <li>marietta attorney; (PARTY NAME) fundraiser and activist , <strong>ronald lowry</strong></li> <li>atlanta attorney; (PARTY NAME) fundraiser and activist , <strong>adam malone</strong></li> <li>atlanta attorney; (PARTY NAME) fundraiser and activist <strong>tommy malone</strong></li> <li>atlanta businessman, the shailendra group; (PARTY NAME) fundraiser and activist <strong>sachin shailendra</strong>,</li> <li>atlanta attorney; (PARTY NAME) fundraiser and activist <strong>glenn sturm</strong></li> <li>columbus attorney; (PARTY NAME) fundraiser and activist, <strong>trip tomlinson</strong></li> <li>columbus attorney; (PARTY NAME) fundraiser and activist, <strong>teresa tomlinson</strong></li> </ul></span>
