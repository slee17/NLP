(candidate last) will create multiple paths to graduation such as second chance schools for former dropouts and smaller alternative schools for at-risk students. he will keep at-risk students in school with the striving readers literacy program and one-on-one tutoring.

[rupri, 2007]</li> <li><b>creating the new energy economy in rural america:</b> renewable sources of energy -- including ethanol, biodiesel, wind and solar -- can make the u.s. independent of foreign oil, cut global warming pollution, and create new industries and hundreds of thousands of jobs in rural america. (candidate last) will establish the new energy economy fund to jumpstart renewable energies with start-up capital. </li> <li><b>fighting rural poverty:</b> the 11 counties with the highest rates of child poverty in south carolina are all rural. to eliminate poverty nationwide within 30 years, (candidate last) will immediately raise the minimum wage to $9.50 by 2012 and then index it, cut taxes for low-wage workers, help workers save and invest and expand affordable housing near good jobs and schools. [census bureau, 2000]</li> </ul> <h3>helping rural towns and counties</h3> <ul><li><b>guaranteeing rural america the funding it needs and is entitled to:</b> more than half of the u.s. department of agriculture's $70 billion in rural development funds has gone to metropolitan regions, suburbs and resort towns like martha's vineyard.

[washington post, 4/6/07]</li> <li><b>improving rural health care:</b> there is a widespread shortage of nurses in rural south carolina. more than 1,000 nursing jobs are opening up every year in the state. addressing the shortage would produce more than $139 million in economic benefits and priceless health care benefits.

[nvfc, 2007] </li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 align="center">building one america: a plan for opportunity for all americans</h2> <blockquote> <p>"i believe that everyone in america—regardless of the family you were born into, the color of your skin or the country your family came from—should have an equal chance to build a better life." - (candidate full) </p></blockquote> <p>there are still two americas—one favored and the other forgotten. while they are not defined by race, the two americas have a disproportionate impact on people of color and in many ways reflect the tragic history of race in this country. the hateful legacy of racism—slavery, segregation, and then discrimination—continues to be felt in every single part of american life. </p><p>for example, the economic impact is apparent in the racial wealth gap: african americans have less than a dime in assets for every dollar that white families have. current economic policies have americans growing apart: between 2001 and 2005, the top 1 percent of households gained $268 billion of total income and the bottom 90 percent lost $272 billion ($2,071 per household). [demos, 2006; epi, 2007] </p><p>as someone who grew up in the segregated south, (candidate full) feels a special responsibility on the issue of race in america and has made equality of opportunity the central tenet of his campaign. to build one america and make sure everyone has the same chances that america has given to him, he supports: </p><h4> guaranteeing health care for every american </h4> <p>forty-five million americans – including one out of five african americans – don't have health insurance. families with insurance struggle to pay skyrocketing premiums and co-payments. (candidate last) is the only major candidate with a specific plan for truly universal health care that takes on the insurance and drug companies and provides better care at a lower cost. he will address shameful racial and ethnic health disparities with new research, preventive care without co-payments, pro-active treatment for chronic diseases and increased diversity among health care professionals. </p><h4> strengthening schools so every child can succeed </h4> <p>more than 50 years after brown v. board of education, our education system remains shockingly unequal. in some areas, african-american students have only about a 50 percent chance of graduating from high school. states spend $900 less per student in their most diverse school districts. (candidate last) will invest in teacher pay and training to attract teachers where we need them most; reduce class sizes; create second-chance schools and take other steps to help dropouts get back on track; expand preschool; and strengthen high school curriculum. (candidate last) has also proposed providing new federal resources to promote economic diversity in schools, while supporting additional steps to promote racial integration as well. he will also make college more affordable through his college for everyone program that will pay the first year of public-college tuition, books and fees for students willing to work part-time and stay out of trouble. [urban institute, 2004; weiner &amp; pristoop, 2006] </p><h4> ending the disgrace of two criminal justice systems </h4> <p>our prison population has increased more than tenfold in the course of a single generation, with a disproportionate impact on african-american communities. (candidate last) will reform sentencing rules to address the disparity in punishments for crimes involving crack and powder cocaine and limit mandatory minimum sentences for first-time, non-violent offenses. (candidate last) supports alternatives to incarceration – such as drug courts – for first-time, non-violent offenders as well as re-entry programs that include drug treatment, literacy education and training to help ex-offenders get back on their feet. </p><h4> creating safe and affordable housing </h4> <p>more new jobs have been created in the suburbs, outside the inner cities where many african-americans live and beyond the reach of mass transit. african-americans have the lowest homeownership rate in the country. predatory lenders have targeted african-american homeowners. (candidate last) will promote economically integrated neighborhoods, enforce fair housing laws, encourage more affordable housing, create more than 1 million new housing vouchers and crack down on the scourge of predatory mortgage lending. </p><h4> protecting the right to vote </h4> <p>forty years after the voting rights act, we still have more work to do to ensure a meaningful right to vote for every american regardless of their skin color. (candidate last) will restore the right to vote in all federal elections to ex-offenders who have served their sentences. (candidate last) supports secure and accessible voting ballots for all voting machines. (candidate last) believes we should allow voters to register on election day, ending the fiasco of purge lists, provisional ballots and voter registration intimidation, and he opposes voter photo identification legislation, which disproportionately disenfranchises racial and ethnic minorities. </p><h4> ending poverty in america </h4> <p>every day, 37 million americans wake up in poverty, including one out of every four african americans. (candidate last) has set a goal of eliminating poverty within a generation by strengthening families, helping workers save and get ahead, reaching overlooked rural areas, and expecting people to help themselves by working whenever they are able. to reward work, he will create 1 million stepping stone jobs, raise the minimum wage to $9.50 by 2012, expand the earned income tax credit and strengthen labor laws to make it easier for workers to join a union. he will also help working families build wealth by matching their savings through work bonds and get ahead tax credits and taking on abusive lenders. [census bureau, 2006] </p><h4> helping small businesses </h4> <p>entrepreneurship has always given minority communities a toehold in the american economy. (candidate last) will increase federal contracting opportunities for minority-owned small business and use the power of the federal government to help small business. to help businesses offering health care, the (candidate last) health care plan will eliminate at least $130 billion a year in wasteful health care spending and reduce the cost of a typical family policy by $2000 to $2500 a year. and new health care markets will bring down costs for small businesses through negotiating power and administrative efficiencies, making it easier for them to care for their employees. </p><h4> environmental justice </h4> <p>the devastation of hurricanes katrina and rita – and their disparate impact on african-american communities living in the low-lying neighborhoods of the gulf – is perhaps the most vivid example of why environmental justice is a matter of life and death. proximity to toxic wastes is correlated more closely with race than with any other factor. pollution and brownfields are concentrated in low-income neighborhoods where big corporations think that the people will not fight back. to give communities the tools to defend their rights, we must maintain access to the courts and disclose the risks of plants. african-americans have high rates of environmental-related illnesses, like asthma and lung cancer, because nearly three-quarters live in areas in violation of clean air act standards. we must enforce the clean air act strongly across the country. (candidate full) is committed to equal justice for all americans, and that includes environmental justice. [mohai, 2007; lowery et al., 2002 ] </p><h4> enforcing civil rights laws </h4> <p>our laws are only as good as the men and women who enforce and interpret them. in many cases, president bush's key agency appointees and judicial nominees have had questionable commitments to equality under law. (candidate last) is committed to strengthening the civil rights division of the department of justice, choosing judges who are committed to protecting civil rights, not undermining them, and appointing officials who vigorously enforce our civil rights laws. </p><h4> closing the digital divide </h4> <p>forty percent of african americans don't have access to the internet. african-american children are about 35 percent less likely to have a computer and internet at home than white children. as president, (candidate last) will establish a national broadband policy with a goal of giving all u.s. homes and businesses affordable access to real high-speed internet by 2010 and prohibit telephone and cable companies from discriminating against rural or low-income communities in building their networks.</p></span>
