<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ today, senator (candidate full) released the following statement: <p>"the (PARTY NAME) debate on tuesday was a defining moment in this election. from my perspective it is important for the next president of the united states to be honest and sincere and trust-worthy given what's happened with bush over the last seven years. instead of straight talk, there was a lot of doubletalk in the debate from senator (candidate last) on some of the most important issues facing the american people. </p><p>"in this election, it is important for voters to know what choices they have. i don't think you can be a candidate for change and say you are going to bring about change and then defend lobbyists and a broken system. those things just don't go together. </p><p>"if you want to be the candidate of change you have to have the strength to say no to the washington lobbyists' money and the courage to tell the truth about why the system is broken and why it doesn't work for regular americans. </p><p>"for the sake of ending the corruption in washington, we've got to have a fresh start and the strength and honesty to fight for real change."</p></span>
