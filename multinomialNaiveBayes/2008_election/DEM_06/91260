<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement in response to a column in today's washington post about his challenge for the (PARTY NAME) party and all federal candidates to stop taking money from washington lobbyists. <p>"my campaign is about giving every american the same chances to succeed that i've had - but that can't happen while powerful interests and their lobbyists run washington. they write our laws to give themselves every break imaginable, while regular families struggle to get by, let alone get ahead. if we are going to build one america, we need to end the money game in washington. </p><p>"i've called on the (PARTY NAME) party and all candidates for federal office to stop taking money from washington lobbyists. a column in today's washington post misunderstood the issue. reforming our party isn't a substitute for changing our laws; it's a critical addition to changing our laws - a huge step we can take today to show the american people that we're the party of the people without waiting for washington to catch up. </p><p>"there are two ways to reform our system. the first way is to pass legislation. i have publicly supported senator (candidate last)'s plan for ethics and lobbying reform. i am also a strong supporter of public financing, and when i am the (PARTY NAME) nominee for president, if the (PARTY NAME) nominee agrees, i will accept public financing of my campaign. but, as we have seen over and over again, every time we are actually able to pass a new law, all of the lobbyists find loopholes to keep the system rigged. </p><p>"the other legitimate path to reform is for our party, the (PARTY NAME) party, to reform itself by refusing to take money from washington lobbyists. by doing this, we are telling washington lobbyists that their money and their agenda are no good here anymore, and exposing for the american people who the (PARTY NAME) party is working for - and it's not them. refusing washington lobbyist money is a huge step in the right direction - that we can take today - to return our country to a government of, by and for the american people. </p><p>"both ways of reform are legitimate and important. but the real question is if senator (candidate last) and senator (candidate last) really care about reform, which i believe they do, then why will neither of them join me and support both paths?"</p></span>
