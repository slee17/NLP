<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ (candidate full) for president campaign manager david bonior released the following statement about senator (candidate last)'s comments about president reagan: <p>"senator (candidate last) was wrong -- frightfully so -- in using ronald reagan as an example of voters reaching for change. the breadth of change ronald reagan brought was crippling for millions of americans with the two worst recessions since the depression, a complete disregard for the rights of american labor, and tax cuts that lined the pockets of the richest americans at the expense of fiscal sanity and the well-being of the most vulnerable in our society. </p><p>"senator (candidate last) may have been more interested in contrasting reagan with bill (candidate last), but it shows particularly bad judgment to suggest this is the kind or even the breadth of change americans want. instead of lauding ronald reagan, senator (candidate last) would do better to remember that it was presidents like teddy roosevelt, franklin roosevelt or john f. kennedy who helped move this country forward."</p></span>
