"we need big, bold change – and the starting place for change is in iraq. last november, the american people voted for real change in iraq, but instead the president has refused to change course. congress needs to stand firm against president bush and not send him any funding bill than does not include a timeline for withdrawal. no timeline, no funding. no excuses." </p><p>(candidate last) has outlined a plan to end the war in iraq and bring our troops home to the heroes' welcome they deserve. he believes that in order to get the iraqi leaders to take responsibility for their country, we must show them that we are serious about leaving, and the best way to do that is to actually start leaving. (candidate last) would immediately withdraw 40,000 to 50,000 combat troops and require the complete withdrawal of all combat troops within the next nine to ten months. he would also step up u.s. diplomatic efforts by engaging in direct talks with all the nations in the region, including iran and syria, to bring a political solution to the sectarian violence inside iraq, including through a peace conference. </p><p>(candidate last) is also outlining his new plan to put an end to the abuses by private security contractors in iraq. the bush administration's outsourcing of security tasks to private industry and political cronies, combined with its poor management and oversight, has led directly to disasters like the recent tragedy involving a convoy operated by blackwater, an independent contracting firm that was involved in a firefight in baghdad that left at least eight iraqi civilians dead. the actions of blackwater have damaged america's moral standing in the world. </p><p>as president, (candidate last) will end our current system of outsourcing security missions to private contractors. he will fundamentally reform our system for security contractors by restoring democracy to our military decisions about the war, expanding the rule of law, ensuring accountability by placing all personnel under clear operational command, and eliminating cronyism from the system of contract procurement. for more information on (candidate last)' plan, please <a href="/issues/military/contractors/">click here for the fact sheet</a>.</p></span>
