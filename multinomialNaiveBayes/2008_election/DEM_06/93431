<span class="displaytext"><b><i>(candidate last) will end the corruption in washington by holding his administration to a higher standard by banning corporate lobbyists from serving in an (candidate last) white house</i></b> <p><b>washington, iowa</b> – today, senator (candidate full) said that he will ban anyone who has worked as a corporate lobbyist or has lobbied for a foreign government from working in an (candidate last) administration. (candidate last) is proud to be the only presidential candidate who has never taken a dime from any political action committee or washington lobbyist, because he's determined to be a voice for regular families like the ones he grew up with. </p><p>"i want to make an announcement today," (candidate last) said at an event in washington, iowa. "no corporate lobbyists or anyone who has lobbied for a foreign government will work in my white house. we will not replace corporate (PARTY NAME)s with corporate (PARTY NAME). i hear people argue that the way that you can get things done is to sit at a table with drug companies, insurance companies, oil companies, and negotiate with them and somehow they will voluntarily give away their power. i think this is a complete fantasy. </p><p>"i am proud of the fact that i have never taken money from a washington lobbyist or a special interest pac my whole time in public life," (candidate last) continued. "i don't think you can bring about change by taking their money or sitting down at a table and trying to make a deal with them. i think if that worked, we would have universal health care, we would be attacking global warming, we'd have a trade policy that makes sense, and we'd have a tax policy that makes sense. i don't think these people will give up anything without a fight – they've been there too long and they have billions of dollars at stake." </p><p>in august, (candidate last) challenged senator (candidate last) and the other presidential candidates to join him in demanding the (PARTY NAME) party lead the way to real reform by refusing, as a party, to take campaign contributions from washington lobbyists. and in october, (candidate last) unveiled his "one democracy initiative" to return the power in washington to regular people and end the unique power of lobbyists. </p><p>(candidate last) called for prohibiting all candidates and federal office holders from accepting contributions from lobbyists and prohibiting federal lobbyists from acting as bundlers for federal candidates. as president, he will limit the ability of lobbyists to secure lucrative earmarks by enacting a constitutional version of the line-item veto, where the president can require an up or down vote on special-interest spending. he also proposed curbing lobbyists' influence by increasing disclosure requirements for lobbyist activity and by prohibiting government executives from accepting gifts and travel from lobbyists and their employers. </p><p>(candidate last) "one democracy initiative" also called for closing the revolving door between capitol hill and k street by reinstating the five-year ban on lobbying by former top government officials. (candidate last)' new proposal today builds on this by banning any former corporate or foreign government lobbyist from serving in an (candidate last) administration. </p><p>over the past few administrations, influencing our government has grown into a big business that employs a mass of lobbyists and lawyers. lobbying expenditures totaled $5.1 billion during the last congress. the number of washington lobbyists has tripled in the past 10 years to almost 36,000—more than 60 for every member of congress. (candidate last) believes it's time to end this permanent government and go back to a jeffersonian model of public service. he believes there are plenty of skilled, honest and talented people from across our nation who will come to washington to serve their country for four or eight years.</p></span>
