[brookings, 2007; berube and katz, 2005] </p><p>today, (candidate full) released his "cities rising" agenda to revitalize america's cities. it includes his ideas for how he will strengthen cities and their surrounding areas by creating more good jobs, strengthening schools, expanding affordable housing, ending poverty, and addressing violent crime. </p><h4> creating good jobs </h4> <p>in america today, families are working harder to get by. over the last 20 years, american incomes have grown apart: 40 percent of the income growth in the 1980s and 1990s went to the top 1 percent. </p><p>the middle-class is eroding in cities, while the percentage of the urban population that is high-income and low-income is growing. [epi, 2006; brookings 2007] </p><ul><li><b>build the new energy economy and create green collar jobs:</b> (candidate last) will create more than 1 million jobs, many in struggling manufacturing communities, by capping carbon dioxide emissions to halt global warming and prompting a shift to renewable energy and energy efficient economy. he will train 150,000 workers a year in green collar jobs to meet these economic needs and ensure that the benefits of economic growth are widely shared.</li> <li><b>enact smarter trade policies:</b> trade deals need to make sense for american workers, not just corporations. (candidate last) will make sure any new trade agreements include strong labor and environmental standards and will vigorously enforce american workers' rights in existing agreements. he will also expand trade adjustment assistance to do much more for the workers and communities that are hurt by global competition and reform our international tax code to remove incentives for companies to move overseas rather than creating jobs here at home.</li> <li><b>strengthen labor laws:</b> unions made manufacturing jobs the foundation of our middle class, and they can do the same for our service economy. federal law promises workers the right to choose a union, but the law is poorly enforced, full of loopholes, and routinely violated by employers. (candidate last) supports the employee free choice act to give workers a real choice in whether to form a union, and making penalties for breaking labor laws tougher and faster, so unions can compete on a level playing field and the right to join a union means something. he also supports banning the permanent replacement of strikers so unions can negotiate fairly.</li> <li><b>invest in innovation and ingenuity:</b> the most important factor for america's future prosperity is investment in education, science, technology and innovation. as president, (candidate last) will make the research and experimentation tax credit permanent. he will encourage research in the life sciences by lifting the ban on stem cell research and doubling funding for key priorities at the national institutes of health. he will also strengthen elementary, secondary, and post-secondary education in math, science and engineering. </li> </ul> <h4> strengthening urban schools </h4> <p>every child should have a chance to get a great education, a commitment that is at the core of (candidate full)' plan to build one america where everyone has a chance to succeed. but more than 50 years after brown v. board of education, we still have two school systems that are separate and unequal. many urban schools are hamstrung by a lack of funding and inability to attract good new teachers. american teenagers – particularly black and hispanic students – trail their international competitors, and these gaps are most evident in high schools in the nation's largest urban and older suburban school systems, dozens of which fail to graduate even two-thirds of their students. [brookings, 2007] </p><ul><li><b>prepare every child to succeed:</b> quality preschool education should be as common as kindergarten. as president, (candidate last) will create great promise early childhood education programs, and make them available to all four-year-olds. he will also create a national smart start initiative – based on north carolina's successful initiative – to link together health care, child care, education, and family support services for children under five. </li> <li><b>put an excellent teacher in every classroom:</b> nothing is more important in a school than the relationship between a teacher and a child. (candidate last) will raise pay for teachers in successful high-poverty schools by as much as $15,000 more a year. he will create a national teachers' university – a west point for teachers – to train excellent teachers for our worst schools. he will also help teachers with extra support in their early years with mentors and extra planning time.</li> <li><b>make every school an outstanding school:</b> (candidate last) will radically overhaul no child left behind to live up to its goal of helping all children learn at high levels, rejecting cheap standardized tests, arbitrary formulas for school success, and unproven cookie-cutter reforms. he will help 1,000 great schools expand or start new branches. (candidate last) will invest more in low-income children, put us on a path to fully funding special education, and raise graduation rates with adolescent literacy programs and second chance schools for former dropouts.</li> </ul> <h4> expanding affordable housing </h4> <p>in central cities, homeownership is half the national average. nearly 6 million americans live in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty inside big cities. nearly every big city has at least one very poor neighborhood – including 46 of the largest 50 cities – and they often include a racial as well as economic dimension. these neighborhoods isolate willing workers from entry-level jobs and children from good schools. [berube and katz, 2005] </p><ul><li><b>create a million new housing vouchers:</b> (candidate last) will create a million vouchers over five years to help low-income families move to better neighborhoods. at the same time, he will phase out housing projects that tie families to certain locations and are often lower quality and more expensive than private sector alternatives.</li> <li><b>revitalize devastated neighborhoods:</b> it is better to invest in struggling neighborhoods than abandon them. (candidate last) will reform and expand the hope vi program to replace dilapidated housing in areas of concentrated poverty, while ensuring that current residents benefit.</li> <li><b>end predatory lending:</b> while subprime mortgages can benefit families with poor credit histories, predatory mortgages include deceptive terms without any benefit to homeowners. millions of families with subprime mortgages have lost their homes or could lose them in the next few years. (candidate last) will create a home rescue fund to get these families into mortgages they can afford and pass a strong national law against predatory lending. </li> <li><b>strengthen enforcement of fair housing laws:</b> housing discrimination is still too common. (candidate last) will strengthen enforcement of the fair housing act and equal credit opportunity act by the departments of justice and housing and urban development. </li> </ul> <h4> ending poverty in a generation </h4> <p>more than 37 million americans live in poverty. poverty rates are increasing in nearly half of large cities, a higher share than in suburbs, and child poverty is rising even more quickly in these areas. (candidate last) has outlined a working society initiative to lift 12 million americans out of poverty in a decade and end poverty within a generation. [census bureau, 2007; berube and kneebone, 2006] </p><ul><li><b>create 1 million stepping stone jobs:</b> every american should have the chance to work their way out of poverty, but some willing workers cannot find jobs because of where they live, a lack of experience or skills, or other obstacles, like a criminal record. (candidate last) will create a million short-term jobs to help individuals move into permanent work.</li> <li><b>make work pay:</b> (candidate last) will increase the reward for working by raising the minimum wage to at least $9.50 an hour by 2012 and setting it to rise over time. in 2001, a $1 increase in the minimum wage alone would have lifted an estimated 900,000 people out of poverty. he will triple the earned income tax credit for adults without children and cut its marriage penalty for couples. the eitc is particularly important to urban areas – it delivers over $8 billion to large cities – and is used primarily for purposes like buying clothes, repairing furniture and appliances, and other activities that create a positive ripple effect through the economy. [berube 2006; sawhill and thomas, 2001]</li> <li><b>help working families save:</b> (candidate last) proposed a new tax credit to help low-income, working americans save for the future. the credit would match savings up to $500 per year. as many as 28 million americans don't have bank accounts. (candidate last) will subsidize bank accounts for working families. [federal reserve, 2007]</li> <li><b>support responsible families:</b> welfare reform required mothers to work and helped them find jobs, but it failed to do the same for fathers. (candidate last) will help fathers find work, require them to help support their children, and increase child support collections by more than $8 billion over the next decade and use those payments to benefit children. the u.s. has one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in the industrialized world. (candidate last) believes we should have more support for teenagers struggling to beat the odds.</li> </ul> <h4> fighting crime and reforming criminal justice </h4> <p>violent crime increased in 2006 for the second year in a row, reversing a long trend of lowering crime. violent crime in metropolitan counties grew by 3 percent and murder in those counties grew by 6 percent. urban households also suffer higher rates of property crimes. [ap, 6/2/2007; fbi, 2007; bjs, 2005] </p><ul><li><b>put more cops on the beat:</b> (candidate last) supports the cops program, which helped hire 117,000 police officers and bring down the crime rate. legislation extending cops is currently stuck in the senate. (candidate last) believes the legislation should be extended to hire 50,000 more officers. he also supports funding for state and city initiatives to prosecute gangs, drugs and illegal guns, while supporting effective youth intervention and crime prevention programs. [rochester (PARTY NAME) and chronicle, 11/26/2007; brookings, 2007; gao, 2005]</li> <li><b>help ex-offenders undertake productive, law-abiding lives:</b> (candidate last) will help ex-offenders return to productive lives with literacy education and drug treatment, stepping stone jobs, and voting rights in federal elections. he also supports strict oversight for probationers and parolees with certain, swift and graduated punishment for probation and parole violations. he wants to increase resources for overworked parole officers and backs greater community oversight and support for former offenders so that people leaving prison don't go back to crime.</li> <li><b>stop racial profiling in law enforcement:</b> law enforcement based on racial stereotypes, such as arrests for "driving while black," violates our principles as a nation. (candidate last) will ban racial profiling in law enforcement. he also supports efforts to reform mandatory minimum sentences and alternatives to imprisonment – such as drug courts – for non-violent, first-time offenders.</li> </ul></span>
