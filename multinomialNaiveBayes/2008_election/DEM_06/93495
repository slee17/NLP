<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ today, senator (candidate full) released the following statement urging senate (PARTY NAME) to filibuster the foreign intelligence surveillance act (fisa): <p>"in washington today, telecom lobbyists have launched a full-court press to win retroactive immunity for their illegal eavesdropping on american citizens. granting retroactive immunity will let corporate law-breakers off the hook and hamstring efforts to learn the truth about bush's illegal spying program. </p><p>"it's time for senate (PARTY NAME) to show a little backbone and stand up to george w. bush and the corporate lobbyists. they should do everything in their power -- including joining senator (candidate last)'s efforts to filibuster this legislation -- to stop retroactive immunity. the constitution should not be for sale at any price."</p></span>
