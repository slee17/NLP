<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ today, senator (candidate full) released the following statement: <p>"congratulations to al gore. the nobel peace prize rewards three decades of vice president gore's prescient and compelling -- and often lonely -- advocacy for the future of the earth. his leadership stands in stunning contrast to the failure of the current administration to pursue policies that would reduce the harm of global warming. </p><p>"the nobel committee's recognition of vice president gore shines a bright light on the most inconvenient truth of all -- the selection of george bush as president has endangered the peace and prosperity of the entire planet. </p><p>"two terms later, americans are ready for bold change, ready to be patriotic about something other than war and ready to take action to stop global warming before it's too late. the stakes are sky-high -- as al gore predicted, our earth is in the balance."</p></span>
