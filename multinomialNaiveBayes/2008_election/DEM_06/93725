<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement today calling for world bank president paul wolfowitz to step down. <p>"fighting global poverty is the moral thing to do - and it's also the smart thing to do for america, because it will make us safer and more secure. poor and failing states too often become incubators for terrorism. taking bold steps to reduce global poverty, like those in the plan i introduced last month, can help to replace radicalism with education, opportunity, and democracy. </p><p>"the world bank should be at the forefront of this effort. unfortunately, wolfowitz's tenure at the world bank has been marked by some of the same failures as his term managing the war in iraq -- cronyism and rhetoric that does not match reality -- and now serious questions of financial integrity that have alarmed our allies. </p><p>"america's ability to lead in the fight against global poverty is undermined with paul wolfowitz at the helm of the world bank. he should resign. we have to restore america's credibility and moral leadership in order to convincingly make the case for global anti-poverty investments that are both strategically smart and morally correct." </p><p>to read about (candidate last)' plan for restoring america's moral leadership by fighting worldwide poverty, go to: <a href="http://(candidate full).com/about/issues/poverty/wordwide-poverty">http://(candidate full).com/about/issues/poverty/wordwide-poverty</a></p></span>
