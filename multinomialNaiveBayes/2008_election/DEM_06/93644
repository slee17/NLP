<span class="displaytext"><h4><i>plan will halt global warming and create a new energy economy</i></h4> <p><b>nevada, iowa</b> — in a speech today at the biomass energy conversion center, senator (candidate full) outlined a bold plan for america to achieve energy independence and halt global warming. under (candidate last)' plan, america can lead the world in stopping climate change, create 1 million new jobs in a new, clean energy economy and freeze our growing demand for electricity. </p><p>"our generation must be the one that says, 'we must halt global warming,'" said (candidate last). "if we don't act now, it will be too late. our generation must be the one that says 'yes' to alternative, renewable fuels and ends forever our dependence on foreign oil. our generation must be the one that accepts responsibility for conserving natural resources and demands the tools to do it. and our generation must be the one that builds the new energy economy. it won't be easy, but it is time to ask the american people to be patriotic about something other than war." </p><p>(candidate last) believes that with american ingenuity and resolve we can turn the crisis of global warming into an opportunity—ending our dependence on foreign oil and creating a new energy economy that embraces innovation, brings rural communities back to life and creates new, good-paying jobs. </p><p>the (candidate last) plan halts global warming, achieves energy independence and jumpstarts a new energy economy by: </p><p></p><ul> <li>capping greenhouse gas pollution starting in 2010 with a cap-and-trade system, and reducing it by 15 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050, as the latest science says is needed to avoid the worst impacts of global warming.</li> <li>leading the world to a new climate treaty that commits other countries—including developing nations—to reduce their pollution. (candidate last) will insist that developing countries join us in this effort, offering to share new clean energy technology and, if necessary, using trade agreements to require binding greenhouse reductions. </li> <li>creating a new energy economy fund by auctioning off $10 billion in greenhouse pollution permits and repealing subsidies for big oil companies. the fund will support u.s. research and development in energy technology, help entrepreneurs start new businesses, invest in new carbon-capture and efficient automobile technology and help americans conserve energy.</li> <li>meeting the demand for more electricity through efficiency for the next decade, instead of producing more electricity.</li> </ul> <hr/> <blockquote> <p>the league of conservation voters, which has not yet endorsed a candidate for president, described (candidate last)' plan as the "<a href="/news/headlines/lcv20070320/">most comprehensive global warming plan of any presidential candidate to date.</a>"</p><p>"<a href="/news/headlines/lcv20070320/">senator (candidate last)' plan demonstrates that he understands the magnitude of the challenge before us and the need for bold leadership to meet it,</a>" lcv president gene karpinski said. </p></blockquote> <hr/> <p></p><h3>fact sheet:</h3> <p></p><ul> <li><a href="/about/issues/energy/new-energy-economy/">achieving energy independence &amp; stopping global warming through a new energy economy</a></li> </ul></span>
