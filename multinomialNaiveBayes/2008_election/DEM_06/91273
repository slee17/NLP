<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – senator (candidate full) released the following statement today urging congress to continue to stand firm on the issue of withdrawing american troops from iraq: <p>"in light of congress' recent failures to pass bills requiring the president to withdraw our troops from iraq, i repeat my call to congress to remain focused and steadfast. </p><p>"congress has the power to stop this war through their constitutional funding authority – and they should use it by tying any war funding bills to a firm deadline that would withdraw all american combat troops from iraq. for the sake of the brave men and women in our military, congress must not cave to president bush. </p><p>"congress must use every instrument available to them, including a filibuster, to pass this bill with a timetable for withdrawal. and if the president vetoes that bill, congress should send it to him again. and they should do this as many times as it takes for the president to finally understand he cannot reject the will of the american people on this critical issue. congress must continue to send the president the simple and clear message: no timetable, no funding. no excuses."</p></span>
