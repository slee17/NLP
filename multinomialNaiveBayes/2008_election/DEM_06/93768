<span class="displaytext">(candidate last) campaign statement on (candidate last) campaign's attempts to deliberately mislead voters <p><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ today, (candidate full) for president communications director chris kofinis issued the following statement regarding the (candidate last) campaign's attempts to deliberately mislead voters about senator (candidate last)' position on universal health care: "today, instead of joining with (candidate full) and standing up for the 47 million americans who do not have health care, the (candidate last) campaign has chosen once again to attack (candidate full) and defend a corrupt and broken system in washington. even worse, the (candidate last) campaign has chosen to make false accusations that totally misrepresent and manipulate senator (candidate last)' words. </p><p>"for the record, when senator (candidate last) said 'who cares?' on 'late edition' this morning, he was referring to protecting the health care of politicians -- not the constitution. manipulating words and lying about them is a tool right out of the (PARTY NAME) playbook. as (PARTY NAME), we shouldn't stoop to that level. </p><p>"it is time for senator (candidate last) to tell voters the truth about why she chooses to defend the health care of politicians, while families in iowa, new hampshire, and all across this country, still go without coverage. the fact is, it is this kind of timid and narrow thinking about what can and cannot be done that explains why -- 14 years after senator (candidate last) failed to achieve universal health care -- nothing has been done. </p><p>"enough is enough. america's health care crisis demands leadership and action, and that is what (candidate full) will offer. when he is president, (candidate full) will say to members of congress and members of his administration, including the cabinet, that if they don't pass universal health care by july 2009, in six months, he will use his power as president to take their health care away. and yes, that plan is constitutional. </p><p>"we look forward to continuing this debate with senator (candidate last) about why she thinks that members of congress should have access to health care, while 47 million americans do not." </p><p><b>transcript of senator (candidate last)' comments on cnn "late edition with wolf blitzer":</b> </p><p>"well, first of all, when i talk about shaking up washington and making this place actually work for the american people, it is an interesting thing to watch that the people who are inside washington -- including senator (candidate last) and her campaign -- they circle the wagons and start to protect washington politicians. who cares? i mean the answer to the question is, yes, the president of united states has enormous power. he has veto power over the budget. the president of united states has the bully pulpit to make this case to america and to congress and to go around america -- by the way, every (PARTY NAME) would vote for universal health care. so it would not be an issue for (PARTY NAME), but it could go across this country and say your congressman or congresswoman is for their own healthcare and their family's health care, but they're not for health care for you. the whole point of this is to shake the place up. it's fascinating to watch how quickly washington insiders, including the (candidate last) campaign, rally the forces and circle the wagons to protect politicians instead of talking about what we can do together to bring universal health care to the country. i will be the first to tell you, i'm going in there to shake the place up and make it work for america."</p></span>
