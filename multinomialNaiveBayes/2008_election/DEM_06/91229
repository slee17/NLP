<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ today, senator (candidate full) released the following statement expressing his disappointment in senator (candidate last)'s support for the peru trade deal: <p>"i am terribly disappointed by senator (candidate last)'s support for the peru trade deal. at a time when millions of americans are concerned about losing their jobs and the economy, it is dismaying that senator (candidate last) would side with corporations, their lobbyists and the bush administration in support of a flawed trade deal that expands the nafta model. </p><p>"as i have said before, there are real and serious differences in this presidential race, and our stands on this trade deal are another example. whereas voters in iowa, new hampshire and all across america have learned that i will fight for safe and smart trade, now they see that senator (candidate last), by supporting this trade deal, has chosen to follow a very different path. </p><p>"it's time for senator (candidate last) to stand up for working americans and stop defending corporate lobbyists and a broken system in washington."</p></span>
