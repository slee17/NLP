<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – senator (candidate full) issued the following statement today regarding president bush's unannounced visit to iraq. <p>"the situation in iraq is too serious for any more 'mission accomplished' photo ops. it's good that the violence is down in anbar province, but it's a homogeneous area that lacks the ethnic conflict that's plaguing the rest of the country. iraq needs a comprehensive political solution and our brave troops deserve better than more of the president's rhetoric that clings to a failed strategy. </p><p>"sadly, now more than ever, we know this president will stop at nothing to keep his failed iraq strategy going. as we recently learned, the president is so confident congress won't stand up to him in this fall's funding decisions that he's actually going to increase his request to fund the surge by another $50 billion—on top of the original $147 billion supplemental he requested. </p><p>"this week, when congress returns, they will have to confront president bush's failed iraq strategy head on. enough is enough. </p><p>"when congress comes back, they should stand firm: no timeline, no funding. no excuses."</p></span>
