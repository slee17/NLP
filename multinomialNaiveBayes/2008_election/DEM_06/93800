(candidate last) urged congress to act immediately to pass at least a $25 billion jobs plan in early 2008 and be ready to pass $75 billion more if there is more evidence that we are entering a recession. (candidate last) believes that every american should have access to a good job and the chance to build a better life. to provide a much-needed boost to a weakening economy, (candidate last)' economic stimulus plan calls for investing in clean energy infrastructure, increasing federal aid to help states avoid cutting programs that help families through hard times, reforming unemployment insurance and tackling the housing crisis. </p><p>today, (candidate last) will be joined on the tour by doug bishop who, in september 2004, was among the first wave of employees to be laid off at the maytag plant in newton, iowa. later that month, doug and his family met (candidate last) as he was campaigning for the vice presidency on the (PARTY NAME) ticket. after eight months out of work, doug found another job and is back on his feet, but many other people in newton haven't been so lucky – the maytag plant is now closed for good. (candidate last) is running for president to make sure the voices of hard-working americans like doug get heard in washington. </p><p>"families across the country are working harder than ever, but in the last seven years, the typical family's income actually decreased – at the same time the costs of health care, energy, and housing are skyrocketing," said (candidate last). "the truth is our economy is slowing under the weight of stagnant wages, a major housing crisis and a spike in energy costs. and now, leading economists are saying there's a substantial risk we could enter a recession. </p><p>"hard-working families across america are already struggling to make ends meet. before things get worse, i urge congress to take action immediately to strengthen our economy and create new jobs. by taking action now, not only will we promote economic growth and shared prosperity in the long run, but these investments will create jobs and cushion the expected economic slowdown and will lay the foundation for a larger job creation package if we need it." </p><p>(candidate last)' "a stronger economy &amp; good jobs" plan will: </p><ul><li><b>accelerate our investment in clean energy:</b> the crisis of global warming and the high cost of energy require us to invest in a new infrastructure as the foundation for a new clean energy economy. building this infrastructure will create jobs and spark economic activity, while also investing in our nation's long-term prosperity. </li> <li><b>strengthen the safety net for workers struggling to find jobs:</b> our nation's unemployment safety net is badly outdated, leaving workers – especially low-wage or part time workers – unprepared for hard times. (candidate last) calls on congress to set aside resources now to help states cover additional workers so if unemployment rises, workers won't have to wait. </li> <li><b>help states avoid property tax increases and cuts in critical programs like medicaid:</b> most states are constitutionally required to balance their budgets, which forces them to raise taxes and cut vital programs like medicaid during recessions. (candidate last) will increase the federal contribution to medicaid and provide additional aid to states, helping them avoid cuts to education, health care and other basic services and avoid increases in property and other taxes that disproportionately impact working families and seniors on fixed incomes. </li> <li><b>tackle the housing crisis:</b> (candidate last) believes that congress must do much more to tackle the mortgage crisis, including creating a home rescue fund to help families avoid foreclosure, giving families the right to rewrite the terms of their primary mortgages in bankruptcy; creating a new federal regulator for financial services products; and passing a strong national law against predatory lending to prevent future crises.</li> <li><b>monitor the economy closely and take additional steps if necessary:</b> if the economy falls into a recession and unemployment rises, as many fear, then additional steps will be necessary. an appropriate package of approximately $100 billion could include additional state relief, additional spending on a new energy infrastructure, accelerating investments in schools, roads, and bridges and temporary tax cuts targeted to the low-income and middle-class families who are most likely to spend money in their pockets.</li> </ul> <p>for more information, please see the "a stronger economy &amp; good jobs" policy paper included below. </p><hr/> <h2 align="center">a stronger economy &amp; good jobs</h2> <p>our economy is struggling under the weight of stagnant wages, a major housing crisis, and a spike in energy costs. the typical family's income fell $2,400 between 2000 and 2006 – as measured by the median income for working-age families – while the costs of health care, energy, and housing have skyrocketed. now, more bad news for regular families: the economy is slowing, the job market is weakening, and there is a substantial risk of a recession, according to leading economists. </p><p>(candidate full) believes that we cannot wait to turn this economy around. today he called on congress to pass at least a $25 billion jobs plan in early 2008 and be ready to pass $75 billion more if there are more signs of an economic recession. by accelerating investments that need to be made anyway, america can generate jobs to offset rising unemployment. the (candidate last) plan will invest in clean energy infrastructure, help states avoid cutting programs that fight poverty, reform unemployment insurance, and tackle the housing crisis. together, these steps will make important investments in fighting global warming and poverty, provide a much-needed boost to a weak economy, and lay the groundwork for a larger jobs package if it proves necessary. </p><ul><li><b>leading economists warn that the economy is weak and a recession is possible:</b> alan greenspan, joseph stiglitz and martin feldstein estimate that there is a 50-50 risk of a recession. fifty-two economists surveyed by the wall street journal put the risk of recession at 38 percent, on average, and traders on intrade put the risk of recession in 2008 at 45 percent.

(candidate last) calls on congress to help states cover 500,000 more workers a year. he also believes that congress should pass legislation automatically responding to a spike in unemployment rates by providing additional weeks of unemployment insurance to workers who cannot find jobs.
