<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ in anticipation of general petraeus' report to congress, senator (candidate full) released the following statement: <p>"i said over two weeks ago that general petraeus needed to answer three questions in his report: has the surge produced progress toward the political solution that's the only answer in iraq? if not, when will it? and if the answer to these two questions is no, then what is the plan for our brave troops in iraq? last friday, general petraeus answered the first question when he wrote in a letter to the troops that his plan for the surge to produce political progress 'has not worked out as we had hoped.' now, more than ever, we need answers to the other two questions. </p><p>"congress must now decide whether they will serve the american people or simply follow the same beltway mentality that has led to more inaction on iraq. even in the face of rising american causalities, greater civil unrest and no political progress, the congress continues a false debate about whether president bush should be granted more time. president bush's iraq strategy has failed, and congress must not cave. congress must support our troops by using every tool available to force the president to agree to a withdrawal. </p><p>"it's been reported that general petraeus may propose the withdrawal of a single brigade by the end of the year in exchange for keeping the failed surge going another six months. this would not be the withdrawal the american people voted for. it would instead be another excuse for the administration to buy time until president bush is out of office and can pass iraq onto the next president. </p><p>"congress must stand strong for the american people and tell the president: no timeline, no funding. no excuses."</p></span>
