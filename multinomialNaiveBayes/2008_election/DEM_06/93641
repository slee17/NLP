<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ in response to (PARTY NAME) presidential candidate (candidate full)'s assertion that osama bin laden is "more symbolism than anything else," sen. (candidate full) released the following statement: <p>"(candidate full) said today that osama bin laden is 'more symbolism than anything else'-- after the recent national intelligence estimate found that al qaeda has rebuilt itself to its pre-9/11 strength. not only has the (PARTY NAME)s' so-called 'war on terror' failed to make us safer, now they're taking their eye off the ball again. </p><p>"i've said it before and i'll say it again. six years ago, president bush declared that he wanted bin laden 'dead or alive.' that bin laden is still at large is bush's starkest failure. i can make you this solemn promise: as president, i will never rest until we have hunted bin laden down and served him justice. and i can tell you one thing: i don't care what bin laden says in his video about our politics or our policy in this country. this murderer of thousands of innocent americans has no right to be heard. the only thing he deserves is justice, and as president i will do everything in my power to deliver it to him. </p><p>"unlike senator (candidate last), i have offered a bold new counterterrorism policy defined by the principles of strength and cooperation that will actually counter terrorism. the centerpiece of my plan is a new multilateral organization called the counterterrorism and intelligence treaty organization (cito) that will unite strength and cooperation to create a new coalition of nations cooperating to root out and shut down terrorist cells." </p><p>"(candidate full) should know better. responsible candidates for president talk about real solutions that will make america safer from terrorism. they don't ignore the fact that george bush's policies have only made the threat of terrorism worse."</p></span>
