<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement today about the latest congressional developments on a bill to fund the war in iraq. <p>"conceding to the president on full funding for the iraq war is a serious mistake. it is time to force an end to this war, and the only way for congress to do that is to use its funding power. any compromise that funds the war through the end of the fiscal year isn't a compromise at all, it's a capitulation. as i have said repeatedly, congress should send the president the same bill he vetoed again and again until he realizes he has no choice but to start bringing our troops home."</p></span>
