<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement about president bush's remarks today on the war in iraq. <p>"the president's remarks today defending his iraq policy without regard to actual facts border on the delusional. the president claimed that the same people attacking u.s. troops today are the ones who perpetrated 9/11. it must be nice to live in a world where your actions have no consequences. there was no group called al qaeda in iraq before the president's disastrous mismanagement of the war gave them a foothold, a fact the president flagrantly ignores. after being discredited again and again, the president is still trying to link iraq and 9/11 - a rationale for the war that virtually everyone except dick cheney has now recognized was false. </p><p>"the president needs to stop pretending and start taking responsibility for the results of his failed strategy: there are more terrorists. al qaeda is resurgent and restored to full strength. and that's according to the bush administration. </p><p>"we need a real strategy against terrorism, like the one i have offered. we need to take al qaeda in iraq as seriously as we take terrorism anywhere. as president, i will apply the full extent of our security apparatus to protect our vital interests, to take measures to root out terrorist cells, and to strike swiftly and strongly against those who would do us harm. i will also launch a sweeping effort to eliminate the conditions that generate instability, radicalism, and violence toward the u.s. and our allies."</p></span>
