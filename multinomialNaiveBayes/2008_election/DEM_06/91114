<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – senator (candidate full) issued the following statement today in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the integration of little rock central high school: <p>"half a century ago, the little rock nine walked passed angry mobs and inspired the nation with their grace and strength. this anniversary reminds us both of their heroism and of the staggering amount of work we still have to do in this country. we still have two school systems – no longer legally but economically and racially. while our nation has made great progress, the quality of our children's education still depends far too much on the parents to which they are born. we cannot go on this way if we hope to build one america where everyone has an equal chance to succeed. it is our obligation to put an end to this inequality. </p><p>"we must also recognize that one of the barriers to truly integrated schools is a lack of income diversity. as president, i'll give bonuses to schools in affluent areas that enroll more low-income students and i'll create more magnet schools in low-income areas. finally, i'll offer 1 million more housing vouchers for low-income families over the next five years, so families can choose to live in neighborhoods with good schools. </p><p>"we must never forget what the achievements of all of our civil rights pioneers contributed to america. we would best honor their courage today by recommitting ourselves to giving every single child the opportunity to go as far as their dreams and god-given potential will take them."</p></span>
