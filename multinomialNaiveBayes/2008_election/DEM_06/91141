<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ today, senator (candidate full) released the following statement: <p>"i saw that senator (candidate last) gave a speech that talked about change versus status quo, and i agree that that's what this election will be about. but i believe if you defend the system in washington as senator (candidate last) does, you're for the status quo. if you want to continue the occupation in iraq, you're for the status quo. if you're not willing to stand up to bush and cheney on iran, then you're for the status quo. </p><p>"we need change very badly. when i'm president, i will shake things up and end the corruption in washington and say no to donations from federal lobbyists. i will end the u.s. occupation of iraq. we need a leader with the strength to stand up and refuse to go along with the bush administration's aggressions against iran. and as much as senator (candidate last) attempts to blur the lines with this talk of change, i believe at the end of the day the american people understand the fundamental differences between the system she has chosen to defend and the change i will bring to america."</p></span>
