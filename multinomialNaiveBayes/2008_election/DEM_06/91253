<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ today, senator (candidate full) released the following statement: <p>"it saddens me to hear that the commission on presidential debates rejected new orleans' bid to host a debate in 2008 citing evidence that the city has not recovered enough to host the event. i strongly believe this decision was a mistake and i urge the commission on presidential debates to rethink their decision. </p><p>"as a nation, all of us have a responsibility to do everything we can to help rebuild this great city, and holding national events in this city, like a presidential debate, will help new orleans move forward. i have made rebuilding this city a central part of my presidential campaign because i believe we cannot stand on the sidelines as president bush continues to fail the people of new orleans. </p><p>"the truth is america is not the country of the superdome in new orleans after katrina. we can prove it by fulfilling our moral responsibility to get new orleans back on its feet. at a minimum, when i am the (PARTY NAME) nominee, i will push to make sure we hold a presidential debate in new orleans. and, as president, i will make sure that our government does everything in its power to help restore the city."</p></span>
