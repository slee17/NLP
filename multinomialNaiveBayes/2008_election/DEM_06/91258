<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ as the senate resumes debate on the war in iraq and president bush prepares to speak about the war, senator (candidate full) released the following statement. <p>"it is more important than ever for people all across the country to let congress know that we expect them to act decisively to end the war in iraq. congress should no longer facilitate the president's stubborn allegiance to his failed strategy. it's not enough to talk a good game any more. it is time to act. the one way to support our troops and bring them home is for congress to exercise its constitutionally mandated funding power, force an immediate drawdown of 40,000 to 50,000 troops and require withdrawal of all troops within about a year."</p></span>
