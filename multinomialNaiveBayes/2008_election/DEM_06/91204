<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement about president bush's comments on taxes during his press conference today. <p>"today, george bush suggested that his priority on taxes would be, yet again, to help some of the wealthiest american investors and businesses. i couldn't disagree more. a month ago, i announced a plan to reward work, not just wealth, by taxing private equity and hedge funds fairly. that means no more special privileges -- charging income tax rates on the fund managers' incomes and corporate tax rates when funds go public. </p><p>"my plan to bring the tax code back in line with american values will prioritize tax cuts for the real engine of the american economy: the middle-class and working families who go to work every day and deserve to keep more of their paychecks."</p></span>
