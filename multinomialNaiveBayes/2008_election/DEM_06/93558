<span class="displaytext"><b>canton, mississippi</b> â€“ on the first day of senator (candidate full)' three-day "road to one america" tour, (candidate last) unveiled new initiatives to respect and reward low-wage workers. the initiatives include protecting workers from routine abuses of minimum wage, overtime, and safety laws through a new taskforce and guaranteeing sick leave so workers who are sick or need to take their child to the emergency room will not lose their job. today's new initiatives build on (candidate last)' past efforts to create opportunities for rewarding work, including a higher minimum wage, tax cuts for low-income families, stronger unions, and stepping-stone jobs for willing workers unable to find jobs on their own. <p>"past anti-poverty efforts have failed to create enough opportunities for people to work their way out of poverty and into the middle class," (candidate last) said. "we will never end poverty until we create more opportunities for people to earn enough to support themselves and their families. we need to put our economy back in line with our values by making it possible to work hard and build a better life." </p><p>in canton, (candidate last) is meeting with poultry workers who are poorly paid and often lack health benefits. he will also meet with home health workers in west helena, arkansas later in the day. (candidate last) believes anyone who works hard should have the chance to get ahead. today though, many industries routinely break basic labor laws. to help protect workers, (candidate last) will revive the department of labor and create a new taskforce to target the industries with the worst abuses of minimum wage and overtime laws. he will also stop the misclassifying of employees as independent contractors, and make workplaces safer by boosting funding for osha inspectors and extending osha protections to all workers. </p><p>(candidate last) also believes we need to make sure workers can take care of their families and themselves. nearly half of all private-sector workers, and nearly 80 percent of low-wage workers, must forgo pay to miss even a single day due to illness or caregiving. as president, (candidate last) will make sure that all workers have at least seven paid sick days a year. </p><p>these new initiatives are part of (candidate last)' agenda to reward work with a higher minimum wage, stronger unions, new protections for home health workers, universal health care, stepping stone jobs and smart trade policies that work for workers as well as corporations. </p><p>(candidate last) has continuously fought for fairness for workers. over the past years, he joined with grassroots coalitions to pass minimum wage increases in six states in 2006. he has also traveled the country helping more than 20 national unions organize thousands of workers into unions. </p><p><a href="/issues/poverty/rewarding-work/">for more details on (candidate last)' plan to reward work, please click here for the fact sheet.</a></p></span>
