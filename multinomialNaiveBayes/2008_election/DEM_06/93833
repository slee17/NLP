(candidate last) wants to hear from the candidates about whether they believe the bush doctrine of a "global war on terror" has backfired. <p>"i believe our experience has proven that the exercise of raw power alone does not make you a world leader, and will not make us secure," said (candidate last). "our capacity to lead requires that we be strong - and that we have the moral authority to do it." </p><p>(candidate last) submitted the following question for the debate: </p><blockquote> <p>"has the bush doctrine of a global war on terror backfired? does the president's focus suggest a fixed enemy that can be defeated through a permanent military campaign or do you think we need a broader approach as many military leaders believe?" </p></blockquote></span>
