<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ (candidate full) today released the following statement in response to president bush's war advisor's comments to consider the return to a military draft: <p>"lt. gen. douglas lute's recent statement that the bush administration is considering a draft reveals the true danger of the administration's breathtaking failures in iraq and around the world. now, instead of ending this war and doing what is right for our troops, their families and the nation, president bush is floating the idea of a draft that would send more young americans to iraq. </p><p>"enough is enough. let there be no doubt that the bush administration's new talk of a draft is a profound measure of how much this president has failed our brave men and women in the military, and the american people. this is exactly the wrong way to go. our all-volunteer force has helped make america what it is today. </p><p>"i call on all members of congress - (PARTY NAME), (PARTY NAME), and independent - to speak with one voice, and say 'no' to a draft. maybe now, in light of lute's dangerous words and the apparent steps the administration is taking towards a draft, congress will once and for all stand up to this president and end this war."</p></span>
