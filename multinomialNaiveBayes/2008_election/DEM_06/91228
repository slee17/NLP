<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – today, at a media availability following a meeting with seiu nurses at st. rose hospital in henderson, nevada, senator (candidate full) made the following statement regarding senator (candidate last)'s response to a question on nafta in last night's (PARTY NAME) debate: <p>"last night's debate was important because it showed distinctions between the candidates on issues that really matter to americans. one moment from the debate stuck with me – when senator (candidate last) was asked about nafta and she tried to joke about charts and laugh about it. </p><p>"for the one million americans who lost their jobs because of nafta, this isn't a laughing matter. and for me, this isn't about charts – it's very personal. i grew up in a mill town, and today in hundreds of towns just like robbins, people's lives hang in the balance because of bad trade agreements. when that mill closed down, it meant less food on the table, not being able to pay for your home or your health care, and financial hardships that were devastating for families. </p><p>"one of the most important choices for (PARTY NAME) in this election is whether we're going to continue to pay lip service to workers while we put the profits of big multinational corporations first, or if we're finally going to show some backbone and strength and stand up for american workers."</p></span>
