<span class="displaytext"><b>manchester, nh</b> – today, the (candidate last) family will conclude their four-day 'fighting for one america' bus tour across new hampshire. senator (candidate full) discussed his bold plan to end the war in iraq and improve medical care and the disability claims process for veterans. <p>"elizabeth and i really enjoyed this tour and thank the people of new hampshire for their hospitality," (candidate last) said. "this was a great opportunity to talk to people across the state and to ask for their support in this effort to bring about the real change our country needs. </p><p>"we need to change course in our foreign policy and end the war in iraq and bring our soldiers home to the hero's welcome they deserve," (candidate last) continued. "that includes honoring the 'sacred contract' we have with our soldiers and veterans to provide them with the best possible medical care and process for providing disability benefits." </p><p>there are currently about 140,000 veterans living in new hampshire. 171 have been wounded and 19 killed in iraq from new hampshire. </p><p>(candidate last) continues to drive the (PARTY NAME) agenda with his specific ideas to transform our country. while washington continues to offer only rhetoric, empty talk and half-measures, (candidate last) is offering courage, conviction and bold ideas to build one america. </p><p>note: a fact sheet on (candidate last)' bold plan is below. more details can be found at <a href="/issues/iraq/">http://(candidate full).com/issues/iraq</a>. </p><hr/> <h2 align="center">standing by our heroes: (candidate full)' 5-point plan to help injured iraq and afghanistan veterans</h2> <blockquote> <p>"i believe in a sacred contract between our country and america's veterans and military families. we must stand by those who stand by us. when our service men and women sacrifice so much to defend our freedom and secure peace around the world, we have a moral obligation to take care of them and their families." -- (candidate full) </p></blockquote> <p>under george bush, our government has not lived up to its responsibility to the men and women who have been injured while serving our country in iraq and afghanistan - wars that have already generated more than 220,000 disability claims.. the scandal at walter reed is only one example of a consistent failure to take responsibility for those who have sacrificed for our country. too often, iraq and afghanistan veterans who fought for our country encounter a system that takes months or even years to make benefit determinations, and that forces them to fight again for benefits. [la times, 7/24/2007] </p><p>the washington post recently reported on army specialist jeans cruz, one of the team who helped capture saddam hussein. he was called a war hero when he came home to his country. he soon suffered debilitating depression from his experiences in iraq. after filing a claim for disability benefits based on post-traumatic stress disorder, he was turned down by the va because they said his psychological problems existed before joining the army. he told the paper, "my experience so far is, you ask for something and they deny, deny, deny. after a while you just give up." [washington post, 6/17/07] </p><p>(candidate full) will not give up on our veterans. he believes we can do better through reforms that will help our injured warriors and make government work more efficiently and effectively. </p><p>(candidate last) has previously announced a plan to repair our country's sacred contract with our veterans and military families by guaranteeing quality health care, supporting military families and providing education and economic opportunities for civilian life. today, (candidate last) built on his existing sacred contract proposal with a new 5-point "standing by our heroes" plan to help returning service men and women with disabilities by: </p><ul><li><b>aggressively resolving the disability claims backlog:</b> the va currently has a backlog of between 400,000 and 600,000 claims for disability benefits, and wait times for initial determinations of up to 6 months. (candidate last) would adopt an aggressive, goal-oriented approach to processing the backlog. as president, he will aim to process the entire backlog that exists when he takes office by memorial day 2009, and will cut the average processing time in half. [cnn, 2007]</li> <li><b>facilitating care for "signature injuries":</b> over 30 percent of these veterans experience psychological problems after returning home. many veterans suffer from the "signature injuries" of this war—post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) and traumatic brain injury (tbi). as president, (candidate last) will increase capacity within the department of defense for recognizing and addressing these injuries by improving training for health personnel to recognize and treat ptsd and tbi, increasing counseling resources within the tricare and va networks, permitting access outside of the networks, and ensuring outreach to family members, who can recognize symptoms. [department of defense 2007]</li> <li><b>providing a comprehensive medical examination:</b> too often, veterans receive their first medical examination months or even years after they leave the service, which makes it difficult to ascertain whether an injury is service-related, creating difficulties and inefficiencies later. as president, (candidate last) will create a new system providing each service member with a comprehensive, standardized medical examination before or immediately after leaving the service, and will link that examination with the disability rating. both will be included in a new "homefront redeployment plan" every veteran will receive.</li> <li><b>fixing the dod/va disconnect:</b> today, veterans face a bureaucratic maze with two different agencies and needless overlaps. the veterans administration and the department of defense have conflicting criteria and overlapping disability determinations. as president, (candidate last) will have only the va make disability determinations, and will launch a broad effort to coordinate all dod and va functions.</li> <li><b>increasing caseworkers and training:</b> caseworkers provide an extremely valuable service to veterans facing a thicket of regulations and forms, particularly older veterans unfamiliar with web-based forms. caseworkers also help families struggling with consequences of an injury. as president, (candidate last) will hire at least 300 more va caseworkers, and implement an accelerated training program including family outreach.</li> </ul></span>
