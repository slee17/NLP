<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – senator (candidate full) released the following statement today on the need for clear, direct answers on how we will reach universal health care: <p>"we need true universal health care reform that covers every single man, woman, and child in america. it is wrong to leave anyone without the care they need. a universal system will work better for all of us – delivering better care at lower cost. </p><p>"(candidate full)'s plan leaves out 15 million people. the truth is that some people will choose not to buy insurance even though it's affordable, knowing that the rest of us will pay for their emergency room visits. </p><p>"but it is just as bad to say that everyone will have insurance without a plan to get there. (candidate full) says her plan will cover everyone through a 'mandate' but does not provide even the most rudimentary idea much less a detailed plan of how this 'mandate' would work. to get fundamental change in our health care system, we need a fundamental change in our politics. that starts with being clear and direct about what we are going to do and how we are going to do it." </p><p>(candidate last)' truly universal health care plan will ensure that every american has health insurance. he will require proof of insurance when income taxes are paid and when health care is provided. families without insurance will be enrolled in medicare, medicaid, schip or another targeted plan or be assigned a plan within new health care markets. </p><p>families who lose coverage will be expected to enroll in another plan or be assigned one. for the few people who refuse to pay, the government will help collect back premiums with interest and collection costs by using tools like the ones it uses for student loans and taxes, including collection agencies and wage garnishment.</p></span>
