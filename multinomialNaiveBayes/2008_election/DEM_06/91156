<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement on equal pay day to encourage fair pay for all americans. <p>"the cause of equality and respect for women has taken a series of blows in april. on the heels of don imus's degrading comments and a supreme court decision limiting women's reproductive health choices, today reminds us that women still lack equality of opportunity. </p><p>"we must work to take equal pay day off the national calendar, by putting real pay equity on the national agenda. women earn 77 cents on the dollar earned by men; the disparity for african-american and latina women is even more striking. while women make up less than half of the workforce, they are 60% of people working at or near minimum wage. these facts have serious consequences for families struggling to make ends meet. </p><p>"a fair and just society must reward work equally, without discrimination, and reflect the needs of women for greater flexibility in the workplace. as president, i will help parents balance work and family by expanding access to quality preschool and after-school programs and expanding family and medical leave. we must also strengthen the remedies for sex discrimination to deter wrongdoing. i was a sponsor of the paycheck fairness act when i was in the senate, and congress should pass the law before another year goes by."</p></span>
