<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement following today's comments by president bush expressing confidence in attorney general alberto gonzales. (candidate last) first called for gonzales to resign on march 13th, 2007. <p>"the american people rightly lose a little more confidence in george bush every time he expresses his confidence in alberto gonzales. when he says gonzales has done nothing wrong, we wonder whether the president has forgotten the difference between right and wrong. </p><p>"the investigation into the partisan firings of u.s. attorneys may be nothing more than political theater to the president. but to the rest of us, it is the first step to uncovering and fixing an outrageous abuse of power. it's time for gonzales to go."</p></span>
