<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – today, senator (candidate full) released the following statement: <p>"just a couple of months ago, george bush was telling us iran was about to start world war iii. today – even after his own government just said that iran stopped its program in 2003 and is no longer pursuing nuclear weapons – bush still refuses to back down from his outrageous rhetoric. </p><p>"enough is enough. at long last, the spin and the saber-rattling must stop. we must once and for all reject the failed, bellicose, neoconservative foreign policy of the bush administration, and get back to the foreign policy i have proposed based on diplomacy, reengagement, and restoring the moral authority of america."</p></span>
