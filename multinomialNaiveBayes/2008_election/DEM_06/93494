(candidate full)' campaign for president offers a much-needed vision that recognizes the hope and promise of america. it's a view that includes solidifying the plight of working families and others in the middle class. </p><p>this group of americans has struggled the past eight years under an administration that has catered to the well-connected and powerful, and it's time for leadership that understands the contributions and needs of american families. </p><p>we believe that (candidate full) can provide that leadership and urge (PARTY NAME) and independent voters to support him in the california primary on feb. 5. </p><p>(candidate last) has been running behind sen. (candidate full) and sen. (candidate full) in the early primary and caucus states, and we recognize that he needs to do better if he is going to have a chance of winning the nomination. we believe that (candidate last) has the opportunity to do well in the upcoming states as his message of hope begins to be heard. </p><p>(candidate last) has a realistic plan for withdrawing this nation from the quagmire of the iraq war. he has proposed reducing troop levels by 40,000 to 50,000 immediately and then withdrawing all "combat" troops in 10 months. he would station about 10,000 troops in neighboring countries to serve as "quick reaction forces" if al-qaida attempts to make iraq a safe haven. </p><p>he supports a balanced immigration policy that recognizes the need for an agricultural guest-worker program that would enable farmworkers to "come out of the shadows." he would protect our borders by doubling the border patrol and sanction employers who hire illegal immigrants. in exchange for playing by the rules, he would offer illegal immigrants a path to citizenship. that path would not be a gift, but would include paying a fine and learning english. </p><p>(candidate last) has been out in front in offering solutions to the nation's economic problems, even before the administration realized the depth of the current crisis. his plan includes a $25 billion economic package that would invest in clean energy, expand unemployment benefits, help states that are cash-strapped and establish a "home rescue fund" to keep homes out of foreclosure. his plan could grow to $100 billion if the economy doesn't turn around. </p><p>we supported (candidate last) four years ago in the (PARTY NAME) primary because he offered a real opportunity to bridge a nation that has been divided along class lines. that need has only increased under the current administration, and we think (candidate last), with his populist message, offers a change for the better. </p></blockquote></span>
