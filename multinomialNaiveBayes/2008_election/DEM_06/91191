<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ today, senator (candidate full) released the following statement on the new national intelligence estimate on iran: <p>"the new national intelligence estimate shows that george bush and dick cheney's rush to war with iran is, in fact, a rush to war. the new nie finds that iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 and that iran can be dissuaded from pursuing a nuclear weapon through diplomacy. this is exactly the reason that we must avoid radical steps like the kyl-lieberman bill declaring iran's revolutionary guard a terrorist organization, which needlessly took us closer to war. and it's why i have proposed that we pursue a comprehensive diplomatic approach instead."</p></span>
