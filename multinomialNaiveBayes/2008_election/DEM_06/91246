<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – today, senator (candidate full) issued the following statement about the events in jena, louisiana: <p>"as someone who grew up in the segregated south, i feel a special responsibility to speak out on racial intolerance. to measure our progress in the fight against racism, today our nation looks to jena, louisiana. americans of all races are traveling to jena because they believe that how we respond to the racial tensions in jena says everything about who we are as a nation. </p><p>"when a 'white tree' stands outside a public school, marking a place where white students sit but black students are not welcome, there is something so wrong that the right words are hard to find. when children have learned to intimidate each other with age-old, hateful symbols of racial terror, we are reminded that we cannot take progress for granted. and we must turn to the larger truth: that we still have two criminal justice systems in this country – largely defined by race and class. </p><p>"fortunately, we also still have in this country the desire for racial justice, understanding and tolerance. i am hopeful that justice will be served, these young americans can look to the future, and the community of jena will find peace."</p></span>
