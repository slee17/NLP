<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ in response to reports that senator (candidate last) is planning a "rural americans for hillary" lunch and campaign briefing at the dc offices of troutman sanders public affairs, the lobbying firm for monsanto, (candidate full) for president communications director chris kofinis released the following statement: <p>"while (candidate full) was in rural iowa yesterday talking about his plans to help family farmers, the (candidate last) campaign was in washington, dc planning an event with the lobbyists from the biggest corporate agriculture company in the world. the difference between (candidate full) and (candidate full) could not be more clear. here's some news for the (candidate last) campaign, when folks in rural iowa talk about the problems with hog lots, they don't mean parking lots on k street. </p><p>"(candidate full) believes family-owned farms are critical to america's future and that the corporate greed that's killing the family farm is hurting america. apparently, (candidate full) doesn't feel the same way. while (candidate full) has introduced policies to ensure family farmers can compete against big agribusiness, protect the food we eat and preserve farming communities, (candidate full), beholden to washington lobbyists, is tailoring her rural policy to reflect the needs of big agribusiness. while corporate america and lobbyists may want someone like (candidate last) in the white house, regular americans are ready for someone who will stand up for them and fight for real change."</p></span>
