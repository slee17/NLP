<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – today, senator (candidate full) released the following statement: <p>"i'm disappointed by today's vote to approve the peru trade deal and expand the failed nafta model that has cost us more than a million jobs. however, i congratulate the 132 members – including a majority of the voting house (PARTY NAME) – for their courage in standing up and voting against this flawed deal. the vote should be an alarm bell for president bush: other flawed trade deals, including south korea and columbia, need to be improved before they are brought before congress. </p><p>"i believe that american workers and businesses can compete with any worker or company in the world as long as our government stands up and fights for a level playing field. american workers deserve trade agreements that strengthen and maintain, rather than undercut and erode, labor rights, environmental standards and wages. </p><p>"while i believe senator (candidate last) is wrong to give this president authority to risk american jobs with more bad trade deals, at least he has taken a position. unfortunately, senator (candidate last) has still refused to take a position on this proposal. i believe voters deserve to hear the truth and i urge senator (candidate last) to join me in calling on members of the senate to reject the peru trade deal in the coming weeks."</p></span>
