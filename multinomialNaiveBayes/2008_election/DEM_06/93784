<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> - (candidate full) for president deputy campaign manager jonathan prince released the following statement today on senator (candidate last)' decision not to participate in the fox debate. <p>"we just called the cbc to let them know that we're looking forward to their debate with cnn but we're not going to participate in the proposed debate with fox. there's just no reason for (PARTY NAME) to give fox a platform to advance the right-wing agenda while pretending to be objective. if there was any uncertainty as to fox's objectivity, it was put to rest when they attacked (PARTY NAME) candidates, (PARTY NAME) constituency groups, and the nevada (PARTY NAME) party when their last proposed debate was canceled for lack of support. the cbc champions critical issues that matter enormously to the future of our country, and they deserve to be discussed in a forum that will give those issues - and (PARTY NAME) - a fair hearing."</p></span>
