<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement today about the latest congressional developments on a bill to fund the war in iraq. <p>"the so-called compromise under discussion in congress that would give the president another blank check to continue his failed war is a serious mistake. full funding is full funding, no matter what you call it. every member of congress who wants to support our troops and end the war should oppose this proposal. if you're in congress, and you believe this war is wrong, i urge you to use every power you have to stop it if it's brought up for a vote. block the blank check. </p><p>and i urge all americans who want this war to end to tell your representatives in congress that you will support them if they stand up to the president. tell them you understand that when the president vetoes a bill that funds the troop and ends the war, he is the only person in america stopping support for the troops. it is time for this war to end. as i have said repeatedly, congress should send the president the same bill he vetoed again and again until he realizes he has no choice but to start bringing our troops home. anything less is everything he needs to prolong the war."</p></span>
