<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ today, senator (candidate full) released the following statement in response to the series of import safety half-measures proposed today by president bush: <p>"president bush still doesn't get it. his approach might work if the problem were a few bad apples, but the reality is far worse. the problem is a broken system in washington where weak consumer protection regulations and bad trade deals leave our children and families vulnerable to unsafe products. worst all of all, this is not by accident. well-connected lobbyists who seek to protect big corporate profits fight basic protections. </p><p>"any serious proposal would include at least three tough reforms. first, the consumer product safety commission should be run by someone who actually wants to make consumer products safe, not industry lobbyists. second, the people in charge of keeping us safe should not be allowed to accept gifts and travel from corporations or their lobbyists. and third, we must ban lead in all children's products because there is no safe level. </p><p>"now more than ever, i believe it's time for our leaders in washington to show a little backbone, have some guts, and stand up for the safety of children and regular families, not defend the interests of lobbyists and corporations." </p><p>tomorrow in new hampshire, (candidate last) will detail his latest proposals on reforming our import safety system.</p></span>
