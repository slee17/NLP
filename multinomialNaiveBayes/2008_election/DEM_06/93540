<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ (candidate full) for president campaign spokesperson mark kornblau released the following statement in response to tonight's (PARTY NAME) presidential debate. <p>"(candidate full) will fight and stop terrorists with a strong, smart national security policy that is focused on the mission of protecting americans, not using bumper-sticker slogans for political advantage. according to his own administration, george bush has made america less safe, but the (PARTY NAME) candidates are still tripping over themselves to be just like him. bush's failed foreign policy has left us with more terrorists and fewer allies. the "global war on terror" isn't an anti-terror strategy; it's a political sledgehammer the (PARTY NAME)s use to shut down debate and justify their ideological agenda."</p></span>
