<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – today senator (candidate full) released the following statement on iraq: <p>"after two days of general petraeus' testimony, only one thing seems clear: this president isn't going to change his failed policy in iraq until he is forced to do so. the question now is whether congress will once again cave to his demands, or if they will stand firm and answer the call of the american people who last november voted for change in iraq. </p><p>"my position has been very clear. for over a year, i have called for an immediate withdrawal of 40-50,000 troops—not by next summer, not in the near future, but today—to jumpstart the comprehensive political solution that will end the violence in iraq and will allow a complete withdrawal of all combat troops within 9 to 10 months. some, like senator (candidate last), have said we should only 'begin' to end this war now. senator (candidate last) would withdraw only 1-2 combat brigades a month between now and the end of next year, which for the next several months could essentially mimic the president's own plans to withdraw 30,000 troops by next summer. </p><p>"taking credit for this gradual withdrawal is like taking credit for gravity. these 30,000 troops would have to be withdrawn anyway, unless the president extended tours to an unconscionable 18 months. </p><p>"enough is enough. we don't need to 'begin' to end the war now. what we need to do now is actually end the war. this is about right and wrong. our young men and women are dying every day for a failed policy. every member of congress who believes this war must end, from senators (candidate last) and (candidate last) to senator warner, has a moral responsibility to use every tool available to them, including a filibuster, to force the president to change course. congress must stand firm and say: no timetable, no funding. no excuses."</p></span>
