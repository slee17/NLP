"in reality, his philosophy is denying nine million kids health insurance. while we cannot be satisfied until every man, woman and child in america is covered by a truly universal health care plan, this bill is a step in the right direction and is action that can be taken today. i hope for the sake of our children that george bush stops siding with insurance companies over kids and withdraws his threat to veto the expansion of health care for kids. and if he does veto kids' health care, i hope every member of congress – (PARTY NAME), (PARTY NAME) or independent – will stand up for our children and override the veto. our kids deserve nothing less." </p><p>expanding schip is one of the cornerstones of (candidate last)' plan to cover every single man, woman and child in america. under

<p></p><blockquote><p>"george bush says he has a 'philosophical' problem with expanding children's health insurance. with his philosophy, nearly 9 million kids lack health insurance. we need to put our children ahead of insurance company profits." – (candidate full) </p></blockquote> <p>almost 9 million american children lack health insurance – and 51,000 of them live in iowa. congress is now reconciling two different bills that would expand the successful state children's health insurance program (schip) to cover 4 to 5 million additional children from low-income families. today, (candidate full) called on george bush to stop siding with insurance companies over kids and withdraw his threat to veto the expansion of health care for kids. </p><p></p><ul><li><b>bush says he will veto health insurance for kids:</b> schip is a joint federal/state program that provides health care for low-income children whose families are not poor enough to qualify for medicaid. however, it has not been funded at levels that would cover all eligible children. president bush has threatened to veto any legislation that expands schip to cover more children. he says he has a "philosophical" preference for tax breaks that benefit insurance companies more than low-income families – families who generally can't afford health insurance today with or without tax deductions. an m.i.t. analysis of bush's plan for new tax breaks found that they would actually increase (not decrease) the number of uninsured americans because employers would tend to drop coverage. [white house, 7/18/07; cppp, 2007]</li> <li><b>the insurance industry is helping lead the fight against schip:</b> not surprisingly, private health insurance companies have been leaders in the fight against the legislation that would expand health care for kids. [aarp, 2007]</li> <li><b>the bush administration has misled the public about schip:</b> administration officials have wrongly asserted that only 1.7 million children are uninsured and eligible for coverage under the proposed legislation. in fact, 6.1 million children are eligible for schip or medicaid – many of whom could obtain coverage under the proposed expansion. and although the bush administration has criticized schip as "government-owned" health care, in fact, private doctors and plans deliver care under the program. [cbpp, 2007; cap, 2007]</li></ul> <p></p><h3>expanding a successful program</h3> <p>medicaid and schip play essential roles in helping low-income americans get the health care they need. </p><p></p><ul><li><b>schip has been an unusual success:</b> schip was enacted by congress in 1997 to increase health insurance coverage for low-income children (who did not already qualify for medicaid). approximately 6.6 million children are now covered through state programs that are funded jointly by the federal government through schip and the states.</li> <li><b>iowa's hawk-i program now covers tens of thousands of children:</b> iowa uses its share of federal s-chip funds to operate a program called "hawk-i" that provides health coverage for more than 30,000 kids. [iowa fiscal partnership, 2007]</li> <li><b>schip is now at risk:</b> the schip program expires on september 30, 2007. as is, the program faces significant shortfalls. iowa is projected to be at least $16 million short this year to sustain current levels of coverage. if the program is not reauthorized by september 30, iowa will be forced to cut benefits, cut the number of children participating or spend more state funds to continue the program. [iowa fiscal partnership, 2007]</li> <li><b>renewal is pending in congress:</b> the house and the senate have passed different bills renewing and expanding schip to cover an additional 4 to 5 million children. once they pass a single reconciled bill, it will go president bush's desk. most (PARTY NAME) and some (PARTY NAME)s in congress want to renew and expand the program to cover an additional 4 to 5 million children. about two-thirds of the 51,000 uninsured iowa children are eligible for either medicaid or hawk-i. tens of thousands of these children would gain coverage under the increased funding provided by the house or senate bill. [families usa, 2007]</li></ul> <p></p><h3>a down payment on true universal health care tomorrow</h3> <p>(candidate full) was the first presidential candidate to propose a detailed plan for true universal health care that offers every american the option of a public plan. expanding schip is one of the cornerstones of (candidate last)' plan to cover single american man, woman and child. as president, he will strengthen the federal partnership with states supporting these programs, committing the federal resources necessary to allow states to expand medicaid and schip to serve all adults under the poverty line and all children and parents under 250 percent of the poverty line (about $50,000 for a family of four). </p><p>under the (candidate last) plan, americans will enjoy: </p><p></p><ul><li><b>true universal coverage:</b> every last person in america will get coverage.</li> <li><b>choice of a public plan:</b> families will have the option of choosing a public health care plan.</li> <li><b>reduced costs:</b> the average family would save $2,000 to $2,500 a year.</li> <li><b>higher quality:</b> americans will be covered for preventive care, chronic care and mental health – with no more exclusions for pre-existing conditions.</li></ul></span>
