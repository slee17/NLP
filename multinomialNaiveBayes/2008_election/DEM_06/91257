<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ (candidate full) released the following statement about the unite here radio ads that are running in nevada: <p>"just three weeks ago senator (candidate last) was calling on me and senator (candidate last) to demand that outside groups not run ads on our behalf. these new ads look like the same old nasty divisive politics that both senators (candidate last) and (candidate last) denounced just two days ago. it is extremely important for us to quit focusing on fights between politicians and instead focus on what we need to do for working people, for the latino community in nevada and across the country."</p></span>
