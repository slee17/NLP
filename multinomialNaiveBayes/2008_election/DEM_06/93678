(candidate last) believes that we must both strengthen support for professional firefighters and recognize the contributions of volunteer firefighters who put their lives on the line for little or no pay. [u.s. fire administration, 2006] </p><ul> <li><b>giving back to rural firefighters:</b> (candidate last) will ensure that small-town and volunteer fire departments in iowa get the funding and training they deserve. he strongly supports the rural fire assistance program that president bush has tried to eliminate. the program will help rural districts buy equipment, train firefighters and prevent fires and requires local cost sharing.</li> <li><b>expanding federal security funding programs:</b> (candidate last) will also expand the homeland security programs that help meet the needs of iowa's rural fire departments. he supports more funding for the staffing for adequate fire and emergency response (safer) program, which helps fire departments hire personnel and retain volunteers. he also supports the assistance to firefighters program, known as fire grants, to support training, purchasing firefighting vehicles as well as communications and other equipment, health and safety programs and fire prevention and education programs</li> <li><b>guaranteeing protection on the job:</b> since the hometown heroes survivors benefits act was signed into law, strengthening the public safety officers' benefits program, only two of the first forty claims have been approved. two hundred families of fallen officers are still awaiting decisions. (candidate last) will streamline the process for awarding death benefits to fallen public safety officers, ending the justice department's backlog.</li> <li><b>supporting those who serve:</b> (candidate last) will prevent the irs from taxing the modest local benefits volunteers may receive for their service. he will also protect firefighters from losing their jobs while responding to emergencies, similar to the protection currently offered to national guard members. [nvfc, 2007]</li> <li><b>funding rural america's needs:</b> the federal payments in lieu of taxes program compensates areas for lost tax revenue from federally-protected land. (candidate last) will protect this important program - which brings over $250,000 a year to counties in iowa - from cuts like those president bush has proposed.

[doe / usda, 2005]</li> <li><b>building the biofuels infrastructure:</b> only about 900 of the country's 169,000 gas stations have pumps for the e85 blend of ethanol and gasoline. (candidate last) will require oil companies to install biofuel pumps at 25 percent of their gas stations and require all new cars sold after 2010 to be "flex fuel" cars running on either gasoline or biofuel. [nevc, 2007; driving rand, 2006; doe, 2005; usda, 2005]</li> <li><b>creating new green collar jobs:</b> insufficient skills and training are major barriers to rapid adoption of renewable energy. (candidate last)' "green collar jobs" training initiative will connect over 150,000 workers a year with skills certification and living wage jobs in the new energy economy. the green collar jobs training initiative will partner with employers, unions, community colleges and high schools to prepare and engage the next generation of workers. [nrel, 2007]</li> <li><b>making american vehicles virtually petroleum-free:</b> with a strong ethanol industry that includes biofuels, fuel cells, and hybrid and electric technology, american cars and trucks can be virtually petroleum-free within a generation. (candidate last) will provide $1 billion a year to help u.s. automakers advance and apply the latest technology, including biofuels, hybrid and electric cars, hydrogen fuel cells, ultra-light materials and drive train improvements. he will also help school districts replace conventional diesel with cleaner-burning biodiesel blends in 100,000 school buses nationwide.</li> <li><b>promoting clean farms for clean fuels:</b> making iowa's farms a central part of the solution to climate change will require a concerted effort to control greenhouse gas emissions and protect farmland as the nation ramps up production of homegrown biofuels. (candidate last) will make greenhouse gas reduction profitable for farms through a cap and trade system and incentives for trapping and converting methane emissions for electricity generation.</li> </ul> <p></p></span>
