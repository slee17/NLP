<span class="displaytext"><b>des moines, iowa</b> – as polls show (candidate full) gaining momentum in iowa, new hampshire and across the country, senator (candidate last) continues to make increasingly harsh, negative attacks against (candidate full) - including today in iowa. jennifer o'malley dillon, iowa state director for (candidate full) for president, made the following statement: <p>"it's no coincidence that as (candidate full) rises in the polls in iowa, senator (candidate last) is resorting to harsh attacks. but senator (candidate last)'s attacks can't hide the fact that for (candidate full), refusing pac and washington lobbyist money wasn't an election year conversion – it's something he's done from the beginning of his career. (candidate full) is the only candidate with the courage and backbone to urge the (PARTY NAME) party to stop taking lobbyist contributions. if senator (candidate last) is serious about reform, he should join (candidate full) in this challenge. </p><p>"(candidate full) understands that if you give the powerful interests and washington lobbyists a seat at the table, they'll eat all the food. that's why he helped lead the fight against insurance company lobbyists to get a patients' bill of rights passed in the senate."</p></span>
