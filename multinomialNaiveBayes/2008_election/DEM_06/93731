<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ today, in charles city, iowa, senator (candidate full) made the followed statement calling on senator (candidate last) to take a stand on whether she is for or against the peru trade deal, which would expand the nafta model: <p>"i grew up in carolina mill towns and i've seen firsthand the devastating impact trade can have on american workers and their communities. america is bleeding jobs. now, more than ever, it is time we take a clear stand against the peru trade deal and any other nafta-like trade agreements that will needlessly cost america more jobs and hurt middle class and working families. </p><p>"sadly, senator (candidate last) has chosen to support the peru trade deal. while i am disappointed by his choice, and i hope he reconsiders, at least he has taken a position. unfortunately, senator (candidate full) still refuses to say whether she is for or against the peru trade deal. </p><p>"on all issues, whether it is iraq, iran, social security or trade, voters deserve straight talk and a leader who will have the strength to tell voters where they stand. </p><p>"i believe the peru trade deal continues failed trade policies. it is wrong for america, and i strongly oppose it. as president, i will promote smart and safe policies by negotiating better deals and rejecting bad deals, enforcing the terms of those deals, helping dislocated workers and communities and ensuring the products sold to american families are safe. </p><p>"for the sake of hard-working families in iowa and all across america, i hope that senator (candidate last) will finally take a stand, do what is right and join me in strongly opposing the peru trade deal."</p></span>
