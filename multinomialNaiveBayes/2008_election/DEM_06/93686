<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> - senator (candidate full) released the following statement calling for the resignation of attorney general alberto gonzales following today's report of white house involvement in the recent firings of federal prosecutors. <p>"today's news is only the latest and most disturbing sign of the politicization of justice under president bush. from the abuse of investigative authority under the patriot act to the unconstitutional imprisonment of the guantanamo bay detainees and illegal torture of prisoners at abu ghraib and bagram air force base, this president has consistently shown contempt for the rule of law. </p><p>"attorney general alberto gonzales betrayed his public trust by playing politics when his job is to enforce and uphold the law. by violating that trust, he's done a great disservice to his office. if white house officials ordered this purge, he should have refused them. if they insisted, he should have resigned in protest. attorney general gonzales should certainly resign now."</p></span>
