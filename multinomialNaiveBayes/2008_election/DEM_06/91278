<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) today issued the following statement in response to president bush's recess appointment of sam fox to be the united states ambassador to belgium: <p>"it was appalling when president bush attempted to repay the financial patron of the 'swift boat veterans' with a diplomatic assignment. it is unconscionable that he now seals the deal with a recess appointment after it was clear sam fox could not be confirmed. </p><p>"senator kerry was right to lead the fight that led to the withdrawal of the nomination, and he is correct in saying that 'our country would be stronger if this administration spent more time getting body armor for our soldiers in iraq than it did helping their powerful friends.' this contemptible end run around the senate is an affront to the veterans whose honor fox paid to smear."</p></span>
