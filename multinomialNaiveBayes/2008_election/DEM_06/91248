<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement about the national intelligence estimate that was released today. <p>"today's new national intelligence estimate demonstrating al qaeda is expanding their reach is proof positive that george bush's "global war on terror" doctrine is more of a bumper sticker than a strategy to eliminate terrorism. this administration has failed america - 6 years after 9/11, bin laden is still alive, al qaeda is more powerful now than ever before, and we have fewer allies. as the nie shows, the next president will need a bold new strategy that will attack the root causes of terrorism, rather than wait for the problem to get worse. we need an anti-terror strategy that tailors our force structure to the threat; puts the military, not politicians, in charge of operational decisions on the ground; and creates a new "marshall corps" of 10,000 professionals to stabilize weak and failing states."</p></span>
