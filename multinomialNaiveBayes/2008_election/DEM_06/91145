<span class="displaytext"><b>dover, new hampshire</b> – senator (candidate full) today released the following statement from new hampshire regarding senator (candidate last)'s changing position on iran: <p>"in today's <i>new york times</i>, we read that some of senator (candidate last)'s advisors are saying that her vote on iran was part of her moving from primary mode to general election mode. we don't need a candidate who has a primary mode and a general election mode—we need a candidate whose only mode is truth telling. that's what we need in our president too. </p><p>"there is too much at stake in this election for any voter to be forced to question the sincerity of the (PARTY NAME) nominee. more importantly, after seven years of george bush, the strongest general election candidate will be a straight shooter, not a candidate who changes what they say depending on the day."</p></span>
