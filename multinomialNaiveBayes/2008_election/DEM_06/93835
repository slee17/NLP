'they should not back down from this president and let him continue on this terrible course in iraq,' he said. 'we have to show strength and courage. this is about life and death. this is about war.'" </p><p>martin wisckol of the <i><a href="http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/news/columns/article_1674656.php ">orange county register</a></i>: "former sen. (candidate full) trails (candidate full) and (candidate full) in most (PARTY NAME) primary polls, but he gave a display sunday of his potential to move up. his speech was among the best received at the california (PARTY NAME) party convention over the weekend." he continued, "more importantly, (candidate last) dispensed with the life-story part of the speech heard from others the previous day and used that time to drill deeper into issues. the specificity made him sound better versed and more prepared to enact change. closer scrutiny and comparison of the top three candidates could serve (candidate last) well in the months ahead." </p><p>paul hogarth at <a href="http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/2007/04/john_(candidate last)_pa.html"><i>california progress report</i></a>: "but for those who stuck around to hear (candidate last) speak, his concrete progressive proposals coupled with a passionate and eloquent message won him many converts on the convention floor - including possibly myself." later, he wrote: "while i have not made a firm decision and my opinions may change between now and february 2008, i am now more likely to support (candidate full) because he was both passionate and substantive. delegates who were still at the convention felt the same way, as the (candidate last) campaign table ran out of stickers within minutes after his speech."</p></span>
