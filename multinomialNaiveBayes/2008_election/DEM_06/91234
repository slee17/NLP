<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement about today's 5-4 supreme court ruling upholding the federal abortion ban. <p>"i could not disagree more strongly with today's supreme court decision. the ban upheld by the court is an ill-considered and sweeping prohibition that does not even take account for serious threats to the health of individual women. this hard right turn is a stark reminder of why (PARTY NAME) cannot afford to lose the 2008 election. too much is at stake - starting with, as the court made all too clear today, a woman's right to choose."</p></span>
