<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ today, (candidate last) for president communications director chris kofinis released the following statement in response to senator (candidate last)'s argument for keeping combat troops in iraq: <p>"senator (candidate last) tonight articulated george bush's argument for staying in iraq. senator (candidate last) said we need to keep troops in iraq for multiple missions, including training iraqis and fighting al qaeda. but we fight al-qaeda in countries all over the world without occupying those countries. for over a year, (candidate full) has provided a very specific plan to end the war in iraq. the bottom line is senator (candidate last) still refuses to provide a specific plan and still won't commit to a timeline for withdrawal. and keeping troops in iraq to fight iran, as the resolution senator (candidate last) just voted for would do, could even expand the missions in iraq. </p><p>"this is a real difference between senator (candidate last) and senator (candidate last). senator (candidate last) says she wants to end the war, but she also says she will keep combat missions in iraq. keeping combat missions in iraq means she will extend the war. (candidate full) will end the war. </p><p>"(candidate full)' plan for iraq is very simple: no combat troops. no combat missions. no combat, period. and not by 2013, by 2009."</p></span>
