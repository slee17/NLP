<span class="displaytext"><b>des moines, iowa</b> – senator (candidate full) released the following statement today about the farm bill, which was blocked by (PARTY NAME)s in the u.s. senate. <p>"it's a tragedy that senate (PARTY NAME)s blocked the farm bill today – not just for america's family farmers who deserve fairness, but for our country, which relies on family farms for a safe and abundant food supply. thanks to the leadership of senator harkin and others, the farm bill would have given family farmers the support and respect they deserve. but instead of helping family farmers, (PARTY NAME)s seem more concerned with lining the pockets of big agricultural conglomerates. well, i can tell you the fight is not over. </p><p>"this issue is deeply personal to me. i grew up in carolina mill towns and i've seen firsthand the struggles facing our rural communities. when i am president, i will fix the broken system in washington and stand up for family farmers. i will enforce country-of-origin labeling and our antitrust laws. and i will enact a strong national ban on packer ownership and a national moratorium on the construction and expansion of cafos. i will also limit farm subsidies to $250,000 per person, close loopholes in payment limits and expand conservation programs. family farmers will always have someone on their side when i'm president."</p></span>
