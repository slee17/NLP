[carsey institute, 2006; davis, 2003; census bureau, 2003] </p><p>as a native of a small rural town, (candidate full) knows that america cannot turn its back on rural areas. small towns and rural areas are the keepers of american values like family, work, community, and freedom. america depends on rural communities for a strong manufacturing base, reliable and affordable food, and increasingly for clean energy as well. to make sure they share in our prosperity, we must fight corporate greed and turn the tables on runaway economic disparity. today, (candidate last) outlined initiatives to restore economic fairness and create new jobs and businesses in rural america, help struggling counties and towns, and protect the rural people and their way of life. </p><h3>restoring economic fairness to rural america:</h3> <ul><li><b>support main street businesses and invest seed money in the rural economy:</b> helping innovative small businesses is a promising approach to economic development, but only 1 percent of state economic development funds now support entrepreneurs. (candidate last) will create the rural economic advancement challenge (reach) fund to bring capital and management expertise to small town america. the reach fund will connect investors with rural entrepreneurs, organize businesses into networks to help them succeed together, and ensure that rural areas have access to the investment capital they need. [rupri, 2007] </li> <li><b>creating the new energy economy in rural america:</b> renewable sources of energy -- including ethanol, biodiesel, wind, and solar -- can make the u.s. independent of foreign oil, cut global warming pollution, and create new industries and hundreds of thousands of jobs in rural america. (candidate last) will create a new economy energy fund – financed by pollution permits and an end to oil industry giveaways – will help develop new methods of producing and using corn and cellulosic ethanol, support loan guarantees to new refineries, and support making the renewable production tax credit permanent. it will also support locally-owned biorefineries with start-up capital, skills training to make sure the jobs go to local residents and investments in public-private research partnerships to develop ways to maximize america's biofuel ouput while minimizing pollution, soil erosion, and water, land and energy use. he will also require oil companies to install biofuel pumps at 25 percent of their gas stations and require all new cars sold after 2010 to be "flex fuel" cars running on either gasoline or biofuel. </li> <li><b>creating fairness for family farmers:</b> (candidate last) recognizes that the rules are stacked against family farmers. he supports the strict enforcement of laws against anticompetitive mergers, unfair pricing, and country-of-origin laws. he will enact a strong national ban on packer ownership to stop the spread of large corporate meat packers and create a national moratorium on the construction and expansion of concentrated animal feeding operations (cafos). to help family farmers he will also limit farm subsidies to $250,000 per person, close loopholes in payment limits, and expand conservation programs. </li> <li><b>investing in rural broadband:</b> once a world leader in broadband access, the u.s. is now 21st in the world, trailing estonia. rural households are only about half as likely to have a broadband connection even though digital inclusion is one of the quickest and surest ways to attract businesses. just as fdr's rural electrification initiative brought power to every corner of the country, (candidate last) will set a national broadband policy with a goal of giving all u.s. homes, schools, and businesses access to real high-speed internet by 2010. (candidate last) will establish a national broadband map to identify gaps in availability, price, and speed and require telephone and cable companies not to discriminate against rural communities in building their broadband networks. [itu, 2006; cwa, 2006; pew, 2006]</li> <li><b>prohibiting banks from discriminating against rural america:</b> rural communities have fewer bank branches, fewer per-capita small business loans and more high-cost mortgages. deregulation has led to bank consolidation while small towns rely on community banks to support local businesses. (candidate last) will strengthen the community reinvestment act to prevent banks from discriminating against rural areas and increase investment in rural small businesses. he will also establish a strong national law against predatory mortgages common in many rural areas. [ncrc, 2007; carsey institute, 2006; federal reserve board of st. louis, 2004; sba, 2004; independent community bankers association, 2006.]</li> <li><b>fighting for economic fairness:</b> child poverty rates in rural areas are higher than urban rates for every racial and ethnic group. the highest child poverty rates are in the most isolated rural areas. to eliminate adult and childhood poverty nationwide within 30 years, (candidate last) will raise the minimum wage, cut taxes for low-wage workers, help workers save and invest, and expand affordable housing near good jobs and schools. [carsey institute, 2006]</li> </ul> <h3>helping rural towns and counties:</h3> <ul><li>guaranteeing rural america the funding it needs and is entitled to: more than half of the u.s. department of agriculture's $70 billion in rural development funds has actually gone to metropolitan regions, suburbs of midsize cities, and resort towns like martha's vineyard and nantucket. (candidate last) will rewrite these funding rules and get resources to the intended isolated and disadvantaged areas. because many small towns lack the grant-writing capabilities of larger towns, (candidate last) will direct federal agencies to offer a simplified, one-page grant application for small grants to rural towns and counties, based on the successful cops program. [washington post, 4/6/2007]</li> <li>strengthening rural schools: iowa's rural schools don't get their fair share of funding, and small rural schools often struggle to provide a complete curriculum and attract and retain excellent teachers. as president, (candidate last) will: <ul><li><b>reward rural teachers:</b> iowa's schools are facing teacher shortages in critical areas such as science and math. rural schools have particular difficulty recruiting and retaining teachers. (candidate last) will raise pay for teachers in many successful rural schools by up to $15,000 a year and offer college scholarships for students who commit to teach in rural schools. he will also create a national teacher university to train excellent teachers to serve in rural schools and other places they are needed most. [iowa department of education, 2007]</li> <li><b>break down educational barriers:</b> about one in seven rural students in iowa receives special education services. the federal government's failure to fulfill its obligation to special education and unique funding challenges facing rural schools mean that even a few students with significant special needs can force a rural school to make unbearable tradeoffs. this must change. (candidate last) will reverse the proposed bush cuts to idea grants and get washington on a path to fully funding its share of special education costs. [rsct, 2005]</li> <li><b>raise graduation rates:</b> rural teenagers are more likely than suburban teens to drop out of school and to be both out of school and out of work. (candidate last) will create multiple paths to graduation such as second chance schools for former dropouts and smaller alternative schools for at-risk students. he will keep at-risk students in school with the striving readers literacy program and one-on-one tutoring. [u.s. department of education, 2007]</li> <li><b>support education technology:</b> distance learning through the internet can bring the content of the world's best universities, libraries, and museums to rural and remote areas. software programs incorporating virtual reality, digital modeling, and intelligent one-on-one tutoring systems are proven to dramatically accelerate learning. (candidate last) will invest in cutting-edge research to integrate these new teaching tools and test them in rural america. [digital promise, 2003]</li></ul> </li> <li><b>improving rural health care:</b> over the past 25 years, 470 rural hospitals have closed. iowa 44th in the nation for physician-to-population. the (candidate last) plan for universal health care will cover the 7 million rural americans that lack insurance and establish a nationwide network of safety net clinics and public hospitals. he will rewrite the unfair medicare and medicaid funding formulas that punish rural states and communities. he will also support investments in telemedicine to instantaneously connect distant specialists and advanced equipment with local doctors and patients, allowing better monitoring, chronic disease management, and emergency response. health care is also an important source of economic development, creating jobs directly and attracting businesses and retirees. one study estimated that each doctor was worth more than eight jobs. [winbush and crichlow, 2005; iowa public health, 2007; usda, 1999; wakefield, 2000; kff, 2003] ranks 44</li> </ul> <h3>protecting the rural way of life:</h3> <ul><li><b>ridding rural america of methamphetamines:</b> many areas of rural america are facing the devastating effects of meth abuse. it can be easily, quickly, and cheaply produced and is highly addictive. (candidate last) will invest in enforcing drug laws in rural areas, help states make meth ingredients more difficult to get, and expand programs that successfully treat addicts such as the residential substance abuse treatment program for prisoners. </li> <li><b>protecting the tradition of responsible gun ownership:</b> (candidate last) hunted when he was young and grew up in rural areas where owning a gun was part of a way of life. he respects that way of life and the individual right to own firearms guaranteed by the second amendment. he believes that law-abiding citizens should be able to own firearms to protect themselves and their families, enjoy sport shooting and take part in the time-honored tradition of hunting. at the same time, we've all seen the terrible consequences when guns fall into the hands of criminals and those who could do harm to themselves and others. we can do two things at once: protect gun rights and promote gun safety.</li> <li><b>expanding access to clean water:</b> every household deserve clean, drinkable water and sanitation services, but more than 1.7 million americans lack basic plumbing facilities. rural households are four times more likely to lack proper plumbing than urban homes. inadequate water and sanitation damage public health and impede economic development. (candidate last) will help local areas improve their infrastructure and tackle local pollution problems. he will also establish tough clean air and water requirements for concentrated animal feeding operations.
