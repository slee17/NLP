(candidate last) grew up in a working-class family, working summers in a textile mill. he was the first in his family to go to college and is more eloquent and believable than the other contenders when each pledges to stand up to big business and other special interests. </p><p>he's not capturing national headlines after (candidate full)'s win in the iowa caucus and (candidate full)'s comeback in new hampshire last week. but only a small fraction of the primary votes have been cast. florida (PARTY NAME) can give (candidate last) a deserved boost toward the nomination jan. 29. (candidate full) has the intellectual clarity, values, experience, good judgment and message to represent his party well against the (PARTY NAME) challenger in november. </p><p><b>recommendation:</b> (candidate full) as the (PARTY NAME) nominee for president. </p></blockquote></span>
