<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ (candidate full) for president communications director chris kofinis released the following statement in response to a charge from senator (candidate last)'s communications director howard wolfson that the (candidate last) campaign was distorting senator (candidate last)'s position on iraq. <p>"the issue of iraq is one of the most important issues facing the country and the (candidate last) campaign knows that. the attempt to belittle these serious concerns by suggesting this is about poll numbers is insulting to the american people and the brave men and women who are waiting for a leader to come up with a real solution to end this war. senator (candidate last) has a specific plan that will end this war, but after yesterday's speech, voters have a right to be confused about what senator (candidate last)'s plan for iraq is. does senator (candidate last) support george bush's surge or not? does senator (candidate last) have a specific timetable for withdrawing troops or not? does senator (candidate last) have a specific plan for ending the war in iraq or not? the american people deserve specific answers, not more rhetoric, and surely not more personal washington-style attacks."</p></span>
