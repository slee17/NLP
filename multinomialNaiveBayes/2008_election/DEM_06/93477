"perceptions aside, the race for the (PARTY NAME) nomination is a three person race, and (candidate full) will fight for every vote and every delegate all the way to the convention." </p><p>the new "media perception vs. reality" web feature can be viewed at: <a href="/whereisjohn/">http://www.(candidate full).com/whereisjohn</a>.</p></span>
