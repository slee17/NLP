<span class="displaytext">senator (candidate full) released the following statement today in response to senator lindsey graham's comments on meet the press yesterday, where sen. graham said: "well, i hope we will hold the generals accountable for their work product. i respect general casey and abizaid, but the strategy they've come up with for the last two years has not worked. iraq is not more stable than it was when they took over two years ago." <p>(candidate last) said, "senator (candidate last) is the leading advocate for escalating the war in iraq against the advice of our military leaders, what i call the (candidate last) doctrine. now, one of his top allies is attacking those generals and blaming them for the terrible situation in iraq. that's outrageous. the failed iraq policy lies squarely on the shoulders of the people who make that policy — the president and his cabinet — and senators (candidate last) and graham know that. senator (candidate last) should ask senator graham to apologize to the men and women of our armed forces who have done nothing but heroically serve their country while trying to carry out a broken policy set in washington." </p><p>he continued, "instead of scapegoating our military leaders, senator (candidate last) and senator graham should start listening to them. escalating the war in iraq sends exactly the wrong signal to the iraqis and the rest of the world about what our intentions are there. we need to make it clear that we intend to leave iraq and turn over the responsibility of iraq to the iraqi people. the best way to do that is by actually starting to leave."</p></span>
