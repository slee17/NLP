(candidate last) has now been endorsed by more than 40 prominent (PARTY NAME) leaders in the state. </p><p>"it is so important that we nominate a candidate who will motivate swing voters in battleground states, like wisconsin, to support the (PARTY NAME) party in 2008," said wisconsin state treasurer dawn marie sass. "poll after poll in the red and battleground states shows (candidate last) to be the strongest (PARTY NAME) challenger in a general election match-up with the leading (PARTY NAME)s. (candidate last)' strength at the top of the ticket will help (PARTY NAME) not only to take back the white house, but also to maintain and expand our majorities in congress and state legislatures. and his coattails will help lead (PARTY NAME) to victory in hundreds of other down-ballot races at the state and local level as well." "we need a leader who can compete anywhere in america and win," said joe wineke, chairman of the (PARTY NAME) party of wisconsin. "some pundits say that a (PARTY NAME) can't win in some places in the south, midwest or west. but they're wrong. the right (PARTY NAME) presidential nominee – one who shares our values, understands our issues and offers real and bold solutions – can win these states. that candidate is (candidate full)." </p><p>"the american people are tired of being ignored by the folks in washington. the people who want real change in this nation don't just live in blue states or in swing states – they live in every state in this country and on every street in america," said (candidate last).
