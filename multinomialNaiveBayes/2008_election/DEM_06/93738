(candidate last) will help women and other americans increase their retirement savings by offering a new get ahead credit that will match families' retirement savings up to dollar for dollar. he will also examine ways to modernize social security to compensate women who pay less into social security because they are caring for children or other family members instead of working. [iwpr, 2003] </p><p><b>ending poverty within a generation:</b> fifty-six percent of the nearly 37 million americans living in poverty are female.

(candidate last) will take on the big insurance and drug companies and guarantee true universal health care for every man, woman and child in america. his plan requires employers to cover their workers or help pay the cost; makes insurance affordable for middle-class families through new subsidies and purchasing pools; creates a choice of competing plans, including a public plan and -- once insurance is affordable -- requires individuals to get insurance. [census bureau, 2007; kff, 2005; acs, 2007] </p><p><b>strengthening america's research agenda:</b> more research is needed into the diseases that affect women disproportionately, such as breast cancer and other types of cancer.
