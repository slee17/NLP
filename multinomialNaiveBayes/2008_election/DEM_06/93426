<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ today, senator (candidate full) released the following statement in response to (candidate full)'s comments about (candidate last)' economic stimulus package on "this week" with george stephanopoulos: <p>"the average family's income has actually decreased over the last seven years, at the same time the costs of health care, energy and housing are skyrocketing. but while hard-working families on main street are struggling to make ends meet, (candidate last) is only concerned about the profits of his wall street buddies. </p><p>"the truth is our economy is slowing under the weight of stagnant wages, a major housing crisis and a spike in energy costs. before things get worse, we must take action to strengthen our economy and create new jobs. by taking action now, not only will we promote economic growth and shared prosperity in the long run, but these investments will create jobs and cushion the expected economic slowdown." </p><p>*** </p><p>yesterday, (candidate full) proposed an economic stimulus package to strengthen our economy and create new jobs. he called on congress to pass at least a $25 billion jobs plan in early 2008 and be ready to pass $75 billion more if there are more signs of an economic recession. the (candidate last) plan will invest in clean energy infrastructure, help states avoid cutting programs that fight poverty, reform unemployment insurance, and tackle the housing crisis. together, these steps will make important investments in fighting global warming and poverty, provide a much-needed boost to a weak economy, and lay the groundwork for a larger jobs package if it proves necessary.</p></span>
