<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement today following the white house's announcement that the president would veto the new congressional proposal on funding of the war in iraq. the proposal would give president bush half of the funds he requested for the war in iraq and require a vote in july to determine whether to give the president the rest of the funds. <p>"earlier today i said the compromise under discussion is a concession, and now the president is already saying he'll veto it. the president has just demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt that he cannot be negotiated with, he cannot be compromised with. </p><p>"he is dead set on pursuing his discredited strategy in iraq without regard to the cost in lives, the evidence of its failure, or the clear will of the american people. </p><p>"there is only one way to stop him - congress must cut off funds to prolong the war. that's the only real power they have to end this war. they passed a plan to support our troops and bring them home, and they should do it again. </p><p>"nothing else will work. and if the president vetoes it - if he vetoes any bill that supports our troops but sets conditions - then it is his willful behavior alone that is standing in the way of what our troops need."</p></span>
