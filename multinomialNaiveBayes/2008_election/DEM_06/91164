<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – senator (candidate full) released the following statement on the lieberman-warner bill that was passed earlier today by a subcommittee of the senate committee on the environment and public works: <p>"global warming is a crisis. every month, the evidence mounts that decisive action is urgently needed. at long last, global warming legislation is moving in the senate. </p><p>"but we cannot be limited in our approach by the armies of lobbyists from big oil companies and other special interests. the critical question is simple: are we going to do everything climate science says is needed to save our planet? the lieberman-warner bill says no. worst of all, it gives away pollution permits to industry for free—a massive corporate windfall—instead of doing what is right and selling them so that we can use these resources to invest in clean energy research and help regular families go green. </p><p>"ending global warming won't be easy, but it is time to ask americans to be patriotic about something other than war. if we take the necessary steps, we can emerge from the crisis of global warming with an economy built on clean, renewable energy and more than 1 million new jobs."</p></span>
