<span class="displaytext"><h4>as president, (candidate last) will stand up for the heroes in the classroom – hard-working teachers</h4> <p><b>charles city, iowa</b> – today, senator (candidate full) highlighted the service of america's teachers during a community meeting in charles city, iowa as part of "american heroes week." from thursday, november 1st through wednesday, november 7th, (candidate last) is highlighting his commitment to fighting for the real heroes of america – the men and women whose hard work makes our country great, but who have no voice in washington. </p><p>nothing is more important to our children's future than america's teachers. while pay for ceos and other highly paid workers has skyrocketed in recent years, teachers only earn a fraction of the salaries paid to other educated professionals. (candidate last) believes we need to give teachers the respect and resources they need to succeed. he will stand up for heroes like dennis petersen from charles city, who taught for 35 years, including 27 years as an art teacher at charles city junior high, before he retired. he is now substitute teacher whenever he is needed. (candidate last) has outlined a bold plan to support teachers and restore the promise of america's schools. </p><p>"growing up, i had heroic public school teachers who cared about me, who took an interest in my life, and who taught me the skills i needed to succeed," said (candidate last). "teachers, not tests, are the single most important factor in successful schools. we need to give teachers the pay and respect they deserve. as president, i will support teachers and strengthen our education system, so that every child gets the same great education i received." </p><p>"(candidate full) speaks to the parts of america that a lot of politicians have forgotten about -- the people who go to work, pay their taxes, and live true american lives," says petersen. "he listens to the people and understands where they are coming from. he will not forget the average american working person because that is where he comes from, and he will not forget his roots." </p><p>(candidate last)' plan to support america's teachers and restore the promise of america's schools includes: </p><ul><li><b>preparing every child to succeed:</b> as president, (candidate last) will launch a national "great promise" partnership to give a quality early childhood education to every four-year-old in the country – starting with poor children in neighborhoods with struggling schools. to reach even younger children, (candidate last) will create a national "smart start" program that will improve child care and invest in child health.</li> <li><b>an excellent teacher in every classroom:</b> teachers, not tests, are the single most important factor in successful schools. as president, (candidate last) will increase pay for teachers in successful high-poverty schools by providing bonuses for teachers who serve as mentors or have national certification for excellence. he will also create a national teacher university – a west point for teachers – to recruit 1,000 top college students a year, train them to be excellent teachers, and encourage them to teach where they are needed the most. his plan also will give extra support to teachers in the first years of their careers, reduce classroom sizes, and train more excellent principals.</li> <li><b>radically overhauling no child left behind:</b> no child left behind used cheap standardized tests to measure our children's learning, failed to accurately identify struggling schools, and mandated unproven cookie-cutter solutions for our schools' problems. (candidate last) will radically overhaul it so it meets its goals of helping all children learn through accurately identifying and improving struggling schools. based on north carolina's successful education reforms, (candidate last) proposed a school success fund to allow teams of experienced educators to spend a year at struggling schools helping launch reforms. (candidate last) will also launch a "great schools" initiative to build or expand 1,000 successful schools.</li> </ul> <p>in may, (candidate last) introduced an initiative to improve access to higher education by making college more affordable for millions of students. (candidate last)' college opportunity agenda includes a national "college for everyone" initiative, which would pay for public-college tuition, fees, and books for any student who is willing to work hard and stay out of trouble. </p><p>for more information on (candidate last)' plan to restore the promise of america's schools, please see the fact sheet below. </p><hr/> <h2 align="center">restoring the promise of america's schools</h2> <p>as the product of public schools in a small rural town and the father of four children who attended public schools, (candidate full) understands the importance of education. he believes every child should have the same chance to get a great education – a commitment that is at the core of his plan to build one america where everyone has a chance to succeed. but more than 50 years after brown v. board of education, we still have two school systems that are separate and unequal. no longer legally separated by race, our children are sorted by economics, often with a racial or ethnic dimension. at the same time, our children are preparing for unprecedented global economic competition. </p><p>unfortunately, washington is letting down our children. george bush's no child left behind law is not working for schools, teachers and – most importantly – our children, and it needs to be radically overhauled. and washington is simply not doing its part to invest in early childhood education, teachers, or helping struggling schools. our students are falling behind in key subjects like math and science, good teachers are leaving the profession, and our graduates aren't as prepared for the global economy as their peers in other countries. students in poor rural areas and major cities often don't have the same chances as other students, and an achievement gap that falls along economic and racial or ethnic lines undermines the promise of equality. </p><p>today, (candidate full) outlined his vision for excellent american schools, based on three principles: </p><ul><li>every child should be prepared to succeed when they show up in the classroom. </li> <li>every classroom should be led by an excellent teacher.</li> <li>every teacher should work in an outstanding school. </li> </ul> <h3>preparing every child to succeed</h3> <p>half of the achievement gap between children from poor families and their more fortunate peers exists before they start school. quality preschools compensate for the learning opportunities some children miss at home, reducing remedial education, welfare, and crime. its benefits are strongly supported by academic research and the experience of universal pre-k programs in georgia and oklahoma. children from poor families benefit most from high-quality preschool, but less than half of poor children attend pre-school compared to two-thirds of other children. [denton and germino-hausken, 2000; aspen, 2007; ppi, 2004; rand, 1998; barnett, 1996; epi, 2002; education sector, 2007] </p><p>(candidate full) believes that quality preschool education should be as common as kindergarten. as president, he will lead the way toward universal preschool, starting with the children who need the help most. in addition to maintaining and expanding support for existing programs like head start and the child care block grant, (candidate last) will: </p><ul><li><b>offer universal "great promise" preschool to four-year-olds:</b> (candidate last) will provide resources to states to help them offer universal high-quality preschool programs for four-year-olds. great promise programs will: <ul><li><b>teach academic skills:</b> preschool is much more than babysitting; it is a unique opportunity to teach children the skills they will need in school. great promise will help develop children's language abilities and introduce them to early math, reading, and other academic concepts, as well as help develop their social and emotional skills.</li> <li><b>start in needy communities:</b> the federal commitment will begin in low-income neighborhoods where schools are struggling and expand to serve more communities over time. </li> <li><b>be led by excellent teachers:</b> research shows that the most effective preschool teachers have at least a bachelor's degree. lead teachers in great promise will have four-year college degrees and be paid commensurately.</li> <li><b>involve parents and their families:</b> research shows that preschool benefits children the most when their parents are involved. parental involvement will be essential to great promise. </li> <li><b>be voluntary and universally affordable:</b> participation would be fully voluntary for families. tuition would be charged on a sliding scale based upon family income and waived for children from low-income families.</li></ul></li> <li><b>create national smart start:</b> north carolina's innovative smart start initiative promotes the healthy development of children under the age of five. it helps local partnerships make child care higher quality and more affordable, provides health services and supports families. participating children show better cognitive and language skills and fewer behavioral problems. (candidate last) will help other states duplicate smart start programs, prioritizing children who are not served by other pre-k programs. smart start will: <ul><li><b>offer integrated services for young children:</b> by linking together health care, child care, education, and family support services for children under five, smart start addresses all aspects of young children's development and helps them begin school healthy and ready to succeed.</li> <li><b>perform health care outreach:</b> smart start makes it easier for young children to get screening for health problems related to hearing, speech, vision, dental, and learning disabilities.</li> <li><b>sponsor home visits to new families:</b> home visits improve prenatal health and the quality of caregiving after birth. children receiving nurse visits are cognitively more advanced, have fewer behavioral problems, and are less likely to be abused or neglected. the smart start program will fund home visits by registered nurses to 50,000 low-income new parents. [aap, 2004; rjwf, 2006; nfp, 2006]</li></ul></li> </ul> <h3>an excellent teacher in every classroom</h3> <p>nothing is more important in a school than the relationship between a teacher and a child. in a single year, a good teacher can raise student achievement by a full grade level more than a less effective teacher. yet students with the greatest needs are more likely to have less experienced and effective teachers. poor urban and rural schools in particular struggle to attract and retain excellent teachers. while pay for ceos and other highly paid workers skyrocketed in recent years, teachers earn a fraction of the salaries paid to other educated professionals. </p><p>(candidate full) believes we need to invest more in training and paying our teachers to help every child learn at high levels. as president, he will: </p><ul><li><b>raise pay by up to $15,000 more for teachers in high-poverty schools:</b> two-thirds of states do not offer any incentives of any kind for teachers to work in high-poverty schools, and many veteran teachers choose to teach in other schools. (candidate last) will fundamentally change teachers' incentives by helping states pay teachers in successful high-poverty schools as much as $15,000 more a year. the $15,000 raise includes: <ul><li><b>$5,000 for all teachers in successful high-poverty schools:</b> high-poverty schools with high academic performance, good student behavior, and high parent satisfaction could give up to $5,000 in bonuses to each of their teachers, encouraging a schoolwide culture of success. bonuses will grow over time to reward continuing success and give teachers an incentive to stay. successful schools will open their doors to share their experiences with other schools.</li> <li><b>$5,000 for teachers with national certification for excellence in high-poverty schools:</b> the national board for professional teaching standards certifies excellent teachers, but few of these teachers teach in high-need schools. teachers who have demonstrated high effectiveness in a national process, such as national board certification, will be eligible for the higher pay.</li> <li><b>$5,000 for veteran teachers who serve as mentors in high-poverty schools:</b> giving veteran teachers the opportunity to mentor new teachers creates opportunities for career advancement for longtime successful teachers, while providing much-needed guidance to new teachers.</li></ul></li> </ul> <p>to address other recruitment hurdles, (candidate last) will help states and school districts improve working conditions and increase time for teacher collaboration and planning. he will also address barriers for teachers moving between states by encouraging reciprocal credentials and studying ways to make pension plans compatible. [nctaf, 1996 and 2002; sanders and rivers, 1996; jordan, mednro, and weerasinghe, 1997; peske and haycock, 2006; rural school and community trust, 2006 and 2007; ny times, 8/27/2007] </p><ul><li><b>create a national teacher university:</b> while there are some successful education schools, many future teachers graduate without the skills and knowledge they need. in one survey, more than 60 percent of graduates said their education school did not prepare them. because having great teachers is a national priority, (candidate last) will create a national teachers' university – a west point for teachers – to recruit 1,000 top college students a year, train them to be excellent teachers, and encourage them to teach where they are needed most. the school will waive tuition for students who go on to teach in schools and subject areas facing shortages. it will also lead improvements at education schools nationwide by developing and sharing model curriculum and practices and serve as a forum to promote shared certification and licensing requirements across states. [levine, 2006]</li> <li><b>help teachers in their early years:</b> a third of all new teachers leave the profession within three years. students in high-poverty and high-minority schools are twice as likely as other students to be taught by inexperienced teachers. (candidate last) will help states support teachers during their early years. he will encourage a transition year for rookie teachers with smaller class sizes, reduced teaching loads, and minimal extra duties. resources will support structured mentoring programs pairing new teachers with successful veterans. finally, he will support professional development based in actual classroom needs. [ingersoll, 2003; ed trust, 2007; levine, 2006; ncatf, 2006] </li> <li><b>reduce class sizes:</b> smaller classes help students learn more by allowing them to get more individualized attention from teachers. according to a tennessee study, young students in small classes are less likely to drop out of school and more likely to graduate on time, complete more advanced math and english courses, and receive honors. poor and african-american students gain the most from smaller classes. (candidate last) will dedicate federal resources to reduce class sizes, particularly for young children who are learning below grade levels. [krueger and whitmore, 2001, 2002; smith, molnar, and zahorik, 2003; u.s. department of education, 2000]</li> <li><b>train more excellent principals:</b> principals can have a large impact on student achievement by setting high expectations and recruiting and supporting teachers, but many districts face principal shortages and the turnover rate for principals in poor urban and rural districts is as high as 20 percent a year. (candidate last) will help train excellent principals for high-need schools. programs could be operated by schools of education, school districts, business schools, or other non-profits with a proven track record like new leaders for new schools. establishing programs to train 3,000 principals a year will meet the needs of most of the country's high-need urban and rural schools. [education sector, 2007; aspen commission, 2007; leithwood et al. 2004; education week, 9/12/2007]</li> <li><b>use highly qualified teachers for tutoring:</b> no child left behind requires schools that fail to make adequate progress for three years in a row to set aside up to 20 percent of their title i funds to pay for "supplemental service" tutoring programs, often offered by private companies with unproven capabilities. (candidate last) will require that tutors be highly qualified teachers.</li> </ul> <h3>making every school an outstanding school</h3> <p>every child in america should have the chance to attend an outstanding public school that has high expectations for every child. children need to master both basic skills in reading, writing and math and advanced thinking skills like creativity, analytic thinking and using technology. we cannot tolerate the benign neglect of our schools. no child left behind has lost its way by imposing cheap standardized tests, narrowing the curriculum at the expense of science, history, and the arts and mandating unproven cookie-cutter reforms on schools. as a result, it has lost the support of teachers, principals, and parents, whose support is needed for any reform to succeed. </p><p>(candidate full) believes that we need to overhaul no child left behind to center our schools around children, not tests, and help struggling schools, not punish them. he will: </p><ul><li><b>overhaul no child left behind:</b> the law must be radically changed to live up to its goal of helping all children learn at high levels, accurately identifying struggling schools, and improving them. its sole reliance on standardized, primarily multiple choice reading and math tests has led schools to narrow the curriculum. its methodology for identifying failing school can be arbitrary and unfair. and it imposes mandatory, cookie-cutter reforms on these schools without any evidence they work. (candidate last) supports: <ul><li><b>better tests:</b> rather than requiring students to take cheap standardized tests, (candidate last) believes that we must invest in the development of higher-quality assessments that measure higher-order thinking skills, including open-ended essays, oral examinations, and projects and experiments.</li> <li><b>broader measures of school success:</b> (candidate last) believes that the law should consider additional measures of academic performance. the law should also allow states to track the growth of students over time, rather than only counting the number of students who clear an arbitrary bar, and give more flexibility to small rural schools.</li> <li><b>more flexibility:</b> (candidate last) will give states more flexibility by distinguishing between schools where many children are failing and those where a particular group is falling behind. he will also let states implement their own reforms in underperforming schools when there is good reason to believe that they will be at least equally effective.</li></ul></li> <li><b>launch a "great schools" initiative to build and expand 1,000 successful schools:</b> across america, there are public schools that are helping children from all backgrounds succeed, including traditional public schools, public charter schools, small schools, and other models. (candidate last) will help 250 schools a year expand or start new branches. federal funds will support new buildings, excellent teachers, and other needs. among the schools he will support are: <ul><li><b>small schools:</b> small high schools create stronger communities, reducing adolescent anonymity and alienation and encouraging teachers to work together. at 47 new small high schools recently opened in new york city, graduation rates are substantially higher than the citywide average. communities can establish multiple schools within an existing facility, build new schools, and reopen old facilities. [aspen institute, 2001; n.y. times, 6/30/2007]</li> <li><b>early college high schools:</b> high schools on college campuses let students earn both a high school diploma and an associate's degree (or two years of transfer credit) in only five years. in north carolina, governor mike easley's learn and earn initiative raises rigor and aspirations, reduces tuition costs, and relieves overcrowded college campuses. [american institutes for research and sri international, 2007; easley, 2007] </li><li><b>economically integrated schools:</b> while income diversity is not a substitute for racial diversity, low-income students perform best when in middle-class schools where they are more likely to have experienced teachers and classmates with high aspirations. states can build magnet schools in low-income communities and create incentives for middle-class schools to enroll more low-income children. [kahlenberg, 2007; harris, 2006; ny times, 7/15/05]</li></ul></li> <li><b>create a school success fund to turn around struggling schools:</b> improving our worst schools is going to take more than federal mandates of unproven remedies; it will require a serious commitment of resources.a new school success fund will: <ul><li><b>let experts design and implement reforms:</b> based on north carolina's successful reform, (candidate last) will ask teams of experienced educators to spend a year at struggling schools helping start reforms. these educators will tailor comprehensive solutions to each school, rather than adopting silver bullets or one-size-fits-all solutions.</li> <li><b>provide resources to implement them:</b> some schools need more resources to help their children succeed. the school success fund will target resources to the neediest schools. resources will be available to recruit new school leadership and a core of excellent teachers, reduce class sizes, duplicate proven models, strengthen the curriculum, and other reforms.</li> <li><b>emphasize extra learning time:</b> due to our 180-day school year, american children spend much less time in class than their foreign competitors.many other countries have 25 percent more instructional time, which adds up to more than two years by the end of high school. when combined with making better use of learning time and designed with educators, longer school days and years create new opportunities for children to master the basics and a broader curriculum. [ed in 08, 2007; zimmerman, 1998; cap, 2006]</li> <li><b>establish stronger academic and career curricula:</b> the rigor of high school classes is the number-one predictor of college success. even students who do not go to college need strong math and reading skills in the workplace. (candidate last) believes that all schools – even those in small, isolated, and high-poverty areas – should have access to challenging advanced placement courses. and he will support partnerships between high schools and community colleges to help high school students get the training they need for the good jobs where skilled workers are in short supply today. [us department of education, 1997; act, 2006; ed in 08, 2007]</li></ul></li> <li><b>more resources for poor and rural schools:</b> four out of five urban school districts studied nationally spend more on low-poverty schools than on high-poverty schools. rural schools enroll 40 percent of american children – including most children in iowa, new hampshire, and north carolina – but receive only 22 percent of federal education funding. (candidate last) will increase federal title i funding and dedicate the increases to low-income schools and districts and rewarding states that distribute funding where it is needed most to increase learning. he will also invest in distance education and cutting-edge software to bring the promise of new learning technologies to remote areas. [nasbe, 2003; rural school and community trust, 2007; digital promise, 2003]</li> <li><b>meet the promise of special education:</b> more than thirty years ago, congress committed to fund 40 percent of the excess cost of educating children with disabilities, but it provides less than half that amount. george bush has proposed a $300 million cut. (candidate last) opposes the bush cuts and supports getting on a path toward meeting the federal promise. [committee for education funding, 2007]</li> <li><b>raise graduation rates:</b> almost a third of all students drop out of school before earning a high school diploma, and rates among children of color or from low-income families are higher. at nearly 2,000 high schools nationwide – called "dropout factories" – more than 40 percent of students won't graduate. (candidate last) will create multiple paths to graduation such as second chance schools for former dropouts and smaller alternative schools for at-risk students. he will focus on identifying at-risk students and support the striving readers literacy program and one-on-one tutoring to keep them in school. (candidate last) will also fund additional guidance counselors in high-poverty schools.

(candidate last) will create a community corps service programs for high school students. it will provide resources to high schools that choose to make community service a graduation requirement, helping them make service opportunities higher in quality and integrate them into the curriculum.
