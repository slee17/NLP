<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – senator (candidate full) released the following statement following today's supreme court decision in massachusetts v. epa, repudiating the bush administration's position that it does not have the power to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. <p>"it's official—the only thing standing between us and a healthier climate is president bush's refusal to accept the truth about global warming. after today's supreme court decision, the president can no longer claim that he lacks the power to address this crisis. </p><p>"global warming is an emergency that calls for immediate action. we need to cap greenhouse gas pollution as soon as possible and reduce it as far as needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. </p><p>"the choice is not between doing what's right for the economy and doing what's right for the environment. the choice is between doing what's right for both and doing nothing at all."</p></span>
