<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ tonight, senator (candidate full) released the following statement in response to president bush's state of the union address: <p>"the president tonight renewed his call for an economic recovery plan. but the plan he and congress have offered leaves out tens of millions of americans who need help the most. this plan would take months to have any impact, and the people i meet everyday on the campaign trail do not have months to wait. these people are hurting now and need this help now. over the past seven years, typical workers' paychecks have failed to keep up with inflation, millions of families are facing the loss of their homes to foreclosures, health insurance premiums have doubled, and families are spending $1,000 more a year on gasoline. the state of the union may be interesting political theater, but until we find bold solutions to the challenges facing the country, we will be stuck with the same old small, washington answers. </p><p>"and in the chamber of the house of representatives where the president speaks, even though this congress stopped listening to him a while ago, they will still applaud and cheer him. the truth is that washington is out of touch with what's happening across the country. between now and january of 2009, (PARTY NAME) must stand up to this president, stand up for what's right, so he does not continue to forget about the middle class in this country."</p></span>
