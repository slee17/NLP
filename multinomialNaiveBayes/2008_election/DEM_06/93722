<span class="displaytext"><h4>as part of seven-day "stand strong" campaign, (candidate last) calls for smart trade policies that put workers and families first</h4> <p><b>newton, iowa</b> â€“ today, as part of his seven-day "stand strong" campaign, senator (candidate full) will announce his opposition to the expansion of the nafta model with the peru trade deal now before congress. </p><p>(candidate last) will make this announcement in newton, iowa - the former headquarters of the maytag corporation and the location of a maytag washer and dryer plant. the maytag plant, which opened in 1893, officially closed its doors last thursday. maytag was acquired by whirlpool in march of 2006 for $2.6 billion. several weeks later, whirlpool announced it would close the newton factory and former headquarters, eliminating 1,800 jobs. whirlpool is moving production to non-union factories in ohio where workers earn significantly less than their union counterparts in newton. </p><p>"i grew up in carolina mill towns and so i've seen firsthand the devastating impact trade can have on workers and communities," said (candidate last). "presidents from both parties have entered into trade agreements like nafta and the wto promising that they would create new jobs. instead, in recent years we've lost millions of manufacturing jobs, seen wages stagnate, and run up larger and larger trade deficits. </p><p>"for too long, washington has been looking at every trade deal and asking one, and only one, question - is it good for corporate profits? and they haven't looked at all at the harm it will do to workers, their wages, or to the u.s. economy. like the failed free trade agreements before it, the peru agreement puts the interests of the big multinational corporations first, ahead of the interests of american workers and communities." </p><p>(candidate last) believes we need smarter trade policies that lift up american workers. he has proposed four principles to ensure that globalization works for everyone: </p><ul> <li>our trade deals and preferences must benefit american workers and communities, not just corporate bottom lines. this means that they must include strong labor and environmental standards and clearly prohibit illegal subsidies and currency manipulation.</li> <li>our trade policies must lift up workers around the world. making sure that all workers share in the gains from trade is the right thing to do economically, and it will make america safer and more secure.</li> <li>we must understand that "one size does not fit all" in trade agreements. instead, we need to address differences in form of government, rule of law, state of economic development, and the day-to-day trade and business practices of our trading partners.</li> <li>our trade deals must be fully and fairly enforced. (candidate last) will make top prosecutors at the department of justice responsible for enforcing trade agreements.</li> </ul> <p>to mitigate the damage of earlier trade agreements, (candidate last) has also called for revamping trade assistance to help dislocated workers and communities. (candidate last) proposed the creation of training programs for american workers, help for communities to recover from mass layoffs and strengthening the safety net for workers who have lost their jobs. </p><p>during the week-long "stand strong" campaign, (candidate last) is traveling across iowa and new hampshire to discuss his bold and detailed proposals for health care reform, smart and safe trade policies, ending the war in iraq and restoring america's moral authority in the world. one of the highlights of the week was a major policy address he gave yesterday in des moines on corporate responsibility. (candidate last) called for updating the social compact with hard-working americans to protect them from abuse by corporations and help them achieve financial security in the new economy. </p><p>"real strength comes from standing up for the millions of american families who don't have a voice," said (candidate last). "we need a leader in the white house who has the strength and courage to stand up and fight for regular americans rather than someone who defends the lobbyists that are destroying the better america we all believe in." </p><p>for further details on the peru trade deal and (candidate last)' proposals for smart trade, please see the "opposing the peru trade deal in favor of smart trade" policy paper included below. </p><p></p><hr/> <p></p><h2>opposing the peru trade deal in favor of smart trade</h2> <p>after growing up in carolina mill towns, (candidate full) understands the devastating impact trade can have on workers and communities. presidents from both parties have entered into trade agreements like nafta and the wto promising that they would create new jobs, but instead we have lost millions of manufacturing jobs, seen wages stagnate, and run up larger and larger trade deficits. meanwhile, washington insiders have looked at every trade deal and asked one, and only one, question: is it good for corporate profits? today, (candidate last) announced his opposition to the peru trade deal now before congress and called for smarter trade policies that put american workers and communities first. </p><p></p><h3>rejecting the peru deal</h3> <p>george bush is trying to expand the nafta approach to peru, panama, south korea and colombia. nafta was written by corporate interests and insiders in the u.s., canada and mexico, but workers have lost out, both american and mexican. under nafta, the u.s. has lost more than 1 million jobs, while average wages for mexican manufacturing workers have fallen by 12 percent. </p><ul> <li>despite progress on labor and environmental standards, worker rights are no stronger than george bush's willingness to enforce them. he has proven his indifference to workers through seven years of inaction.</li> <li>congress should not pass further trade deals without first taking steps to address the stagnant wages and insecurity caused by globalization. congress needs to adopt universal health care, reform the tax code, strengthen unions, and expand and renew trade adjustment assistance.</li> <li>the four trade deals which have been proposed establish expansive investor rights that actually create incentives to further relocate u.s. jobs overseas, by compensating corporations if our environmental, health or even local zoning laws allegedly undermine their expected profits. they also unfairly allow foreign corporations to challenge many of our laws.</li> <li>the proposed deals even limit how we can spend our own tax dollars by banning many buy america policies.</li> </ul> <p></p><h3>calling for smart trade policies</h3> <p>(candidate full) believes we need smarter trade policies that lift up american workers. he has proposed four principles to ensure that globalization works for everyone: </p><ul> <li>our trade deals and preferences must benefit american workers and communities, not just corporate bottom lines. this means that they must include strong labor and environmental standards and clearly prohibit illegal subsidies and currency manipulation.</li> <li>our trade policies must lift up workers around the world. making sure that all workers share in the gains from trade is the right thing to do economically, and it will make america safer and more secure.</li> <li>we must understand that "one size does not fit all" in trade agreements. instead, we need to address differences in form of government, rule of law, state of economic development, and the day-to-day trade and business practices of our trading partners.</li> <li>our trade deals must be fully and fairly enforced.
