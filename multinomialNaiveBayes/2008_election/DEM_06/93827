<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – senator (candidate full) sent the following letter to news networks, asking them to make video footage from the presidential debates that they broadcast available to the public. <blockquote> <p>may 3, 2007 </p><p>mr. jim walton – cnn<br/> mr. leslie moonves – cbs<br/> mr. jeffrey zucker – nbc universal<br/> ms. anne sweeney – disney-abc television group<br/> ms. paula kerger – pbs<br/> dr. howard dean – dnc</p><p>dear messrs walton, moonves and zucker, mses. sweeney and kerger, and dr. dean: </p><p>selecting a president is the most important responsibility americans have. in an age of 30-second ads, 7-second sound bites and media consolidation, making an informed decision is harder than ever. </p><p>that is why i am asking each news network to make video footage from the presidential debates that they broadcast available on the internet for the public to view and use responsibly. i am also asking chairman dean, who is playing a valuable role in organizing many of the (PARTY NAME) primary debates, to use his influence with the networks to make the debates more broadly available. </p><p>the creative commons license terms offer an easy way to ensure that the networks' rights are protected. much of the content on my own campaign web site is available under just such a license. </p><p>commercial constraints are severe enough in their effect in diluting the substance of our campaigns. limiting access to long-form televised debates makes matters worse. </p><p>sincerely, </p><p>(candidate full) </p></blockquote></span>
