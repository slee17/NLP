<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement about today's release from the bureau of labor statistics, showing the largest increase in union membership since 1979. <p>"i salute the courage, tenacity, and success of the men and women who have joined the labor movement in historic numbers over the past year, and in doing so, have helped strengthen the middle class in america. i have stood on countless picket lines and in the trenches of organizing campaigns across this country with strong men and women who simply seek fair pay, decent benefits, and a voice on their jobs. but i know too well the ongoing harassment that these americans face for seeking unionization, and as we struggle with difficult economic times, i will fight even harder to make it easier for more workers to join unions through passage of the employee free choice act, by calling on employers to be responsible and law abiding, and by continuing to stand with workers in their campaigns."</p></span>
