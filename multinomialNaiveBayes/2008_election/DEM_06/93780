<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – today, (candidate full) for president communications director chris kofinis released the following statement in response to (candidate full)'s new ad attacking senator (candidate last): <p>"it looks like (candidate full) wants to offer america four more years of george w. bush – no thanks. (candidate full) will deliver tax cut relief to the millions of middle class and working americans who need it, not the wealthiest few like (candidate last) who don't. but (candidate last)'s attack on (candidate full) shows one thing – that instead of offering any ideas to help the middle class, he's more than willing to ignore the middle class and attack the one (PARTY NAME) who has proposed bold and detailed plans to help american families. </p><p>"truth be told, (candidate full) has taken on the (candidate last)s of the world his entire life and beaten them. and, come november 2008, (candidate full) looks forward to beating them again, no matter who the (PARTY NAME) nominee is."</p></span>
