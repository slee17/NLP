<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement following president bush's veto of legislation that would provide health coverage for 4 million uninsured children: <p>"today, we have witnessed a president that has turned his back on health care for children. not surprisingly, in george bush's administration, corporate cronies and insurance industry allies always come first, while children's health care comes last. in an america where nearly 9 million children don't have health coverage, congress must do what is right and fight for these children and override bush's cruel veto. </p><p>"even more shocking is that (PARTY NAME) presidential candidates, including (candidate full), (candidate full), (candidate full) and (candidate full) are all lining up with president bush and against health care for our children. instead of threatening the health care of children, it's time for bush, and (PARTY NAME)s like (candidate last), (candidate last), and (candidate last) to start picking on someone their own size."</p></span>
