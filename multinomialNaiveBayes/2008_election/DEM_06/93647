"as president, i will proudly lead the fight on behalf of working families with their support—and together we will win." </p><p>representing 1.2 million workers and retirees, the usw is the nation's largest private sector industrial union. following extensive outreach to usw members that included a poll of the union's 15,000 activists, as well as a nationwide survey of the union's membership, the usw international executive board voted unanimously on sunday, september 2nd to endorse (candidate last). </p><p>the umwa represents 105,000 active and retired coal miners, municipal employees, health care workers and manufacturing workers in north america. their membership includes more coal miners than any union in the world. </p><p>both steelworkers president leo w. gerard and umwa president cecil e. roberts announced their endorsement by making clear the stakes hard-working families face and laying out why sen. (candidate last) is the best candidate to lead the fight for change in america. </p><p>"senator (candidate full) is committed, as he has been throughout his life, to going to bat for everyday americans and to changing a broken political system that leaves millions of americans without a voice in their government," said steelworkers president leo w. gerard. "(candidate last) is right on the issues that matter to us, and he's the candidate with the best chance of winning in the general election. the big corporations don't need another president who does their bidding. it's time we had a president who will fight for working people—and that's what (candidate full) will do." </p><p>"senator (candidate last)' positions on the issues of importance to umwa members make him the best fit of all the candidates for president," umwa international president cecil e. roberts said. "we need a president who cares about ordinary working people instead of the richest americans and the big multinational corporations. we believe (candidate full) is that person, and we will work as hard as we know how on his behalf anywhere and everywhere we can." </p><p>close to 1,000 people were expected at the pittsburgh labor day rally where the unions' official endorsements were announced. sen. (candidate last) was joined on stage by usw president leo gerard, umwa international president cecil roberts and local union members. elizabeth (candidate last) and (candidate last) campaign manager david bonior also attended the event. </p><p>on thursday, august 30th, the united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners of america, representing more than 520,000 members from all political affiliations, also announced that they would endorse (candidate full) for president. their formal endorsement will take place at a rally of union members on september 8th in new hampshire.</p></span>
