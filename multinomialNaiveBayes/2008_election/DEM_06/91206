<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement about president bush's comments today about the war in iraq. <p>"the president today asked for yet another chance. we can no longer afford to bet american troops on a chance. in fact, even members of the president's own party are running out of patience with the relentless pursuit of his failed iraq policy. why on earth would congress make a concession to bush when support to end the war may be climbing? congress should stand firm. the only real power it has to end this war is to cut off funds. they passed a plan to support our troops and bring them home, and they should do it again. nothing else will work. and if the president vetoes it, then it is his willful behavior alone that is standing in the way of what our troops need."</p></span>
