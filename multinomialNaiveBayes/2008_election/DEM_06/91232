<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement about today's supreme court decision holding that home care workers are not covered by the fair labor standards act. <p>"excluding home care workers from the protections of federal minimum wage and overtime laws is wrong. in a nation of our wealth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty. it's wrong for workers and it's wrong for the economy. the bush administration may not know the difference between professional home care workers and babysitters, but older americans and people with disabilities who rely on them for quality care certainly do. congress should do what's right and fix the law. if it doesn't, as president i will."</p></span>
