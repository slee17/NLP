<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> â€“ senator (candidate full) released the following statement praising the house of representatives for passing the hate crimes bill yesterday. <p>"as americans, we should mourn the need for hate crimes legislation, just as we lament the fact that 25 americans are victims of hate crimes every day. yet today, we should also applaud the house of representatives for taking an important and historic step in helping law enforcement ensure that all americans have the same protections from hate crimes. </p><p>"today, the house showed in an overwhelming vote, that it will not tolerate discrimination of any form, when it strengthened the ability of law enforcement to investigate and prosecute hate crimes based on race, gender, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, disability or gender identity. president bush should back down from his wrong-headed veto threat and work with congress to enact this important legislation to show that americans will not tolerate hate crimes of any kind."</p></span>
