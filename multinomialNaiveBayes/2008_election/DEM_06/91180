<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – senator (candidate full) released the following statement about negotiations between the white house and congress on an iraq funding bill. <p>"congress began negotiating today with the white house on a bill to fund the iraq war. i am very concerned about reports that a timetable for withdrawal is off the table—ending the war should be non-negotiable. that's what the american people expect. </p><p>"as i indicated in february, the president has no authorization for this war. the 2002 authorization did not give him the power to use u.s. troops to police a civil war. he exceeded his authority a long time ago; now he needs to end the war, and that's what congress should focus on. congress should stand its ground and not back down to him. they should send him the same bill he just vetoed, one that supports our troops, ends the war, and brings them home."</p></span>
