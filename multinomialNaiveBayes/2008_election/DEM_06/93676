<span class="displaytext"><b>(PARTY NAME) leaders from battleground states and red states explain why (candidate last)' strength at the top of the ticket will motivate swing voters, memo shows that (candidate last) is the (PARTY NAME) with the best chance of defeating the (PARTY NAME) candidate in the 2008 general election</b> <p><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – as part of a new "true blue majority" campaign launching this week, (PARTY NAME) leaders from red states and battleground states across the nation will be holding events throughout the next week to highlight their support for (candidate full) for president. these leaders will discuss why (candidate last) is the only candidate with the bold ideas for change and strong leadership needed to campaign in all 50 states and lead (PARTY NAME) to victory in the 2008 general election. the events will also highlight why these leaders believe that having (candidate last) at the top of the ticket will motivate swing voters to ensure that (PARTY NAME) maintain and expand (PARTY NAME) majorities in congress and lead (PARTY NAME) to victory in races at the state and local level. </p><p>"we need a leader who can compete anywhere in america, and win," said former georgia governor roy barnes. "some pundits say that a (PARTY NAME) can't win in some places in the south, midwest or west. but they're wrong. the right (PARTY NAME) presidential nominee – one who shares our values, understands our issues and offers real and bold solutions – can win these states. that candidate is (candidate full)." </p><p>"it is so important that we nominate a candidate who will motivate swing voters in battleground states, like wisconsin, to support the (PARTY NAME) party in 2008," said dawn marie sass, wisconsin state treasurer. "poll after poll in the battleground states shows (candidate last) to be the strongest (PARTY NAME) challenger in a general election match-up with the leading (PARTY NAME)s. (candidate last)' strength at the top of the ticket will help (PARTY NAME) not only to take back the white house, but also to maintain and expand our majorities in congress and state legislatures. and his coattails will help lead (PARTY NAME) to victory in hundreds of other down-ballot races at the state and local level as well." </p><p>in a memo released thursday, (candidate last) campaign pollster harrison hickman of global strategy group analyzed nationwide general election polling to show why (candidate last) is the (PARTY NAME) with the best chance of defeating the (PARTY NAME) candidate in the 2008 general election for president, saying most notably: </p><p></p><ul><li>(candidate last) is the only (PARTY NAME) with a significant lead against (PARTY NAME) frontrunner (candidate last), and (candidate last)' average margin of victory is identical to or greater than senator (candidate last)'s, well ahead of senator (candidate last)'s, against the other (PARTY NAME) candidates.</li> <li>in looking at the overall win-loss-tie records, (candidate last) again has the best total record.</li></ul> <p>"(candidate last) also outperforms the other (PARTY NAME) candidates in match-ups with (PARTY NAME) candidates in key battleground states including iowa, missouri, and ohio," said hickman. "further, unlike other (PARTY NAME) who must 'run the table' in states where (PARTY NAME) have been competitive in recent elections, (candidate last) brings new states into play." </p><p>on thursday, elected leaders and labor leaders in georgia, oklahoma and wisconsin held press events and conference calls to discuss their reasons for supporting (candidate last). the (candidate last) campaign also released lists of (PARTY NAME) leaders from these states who have endorsed (candidate last), including more than 50 endorsements from georgia, more than 40 endorsements from wisconsin, and endorsements from 32 of the 68 (PARTY NAME) in the oklahoma legislature. </p><p>"instead of defending the broken system in washington, we need a candidate that stands with working people," said oklahoma labor commissioner lloyd fields. "(candidate full) understands that creating economic fairness is part of building the middle class and moving america forward and he will fight to improve the lives of middle class families." </p><p>on friday, (PARTY NAME) legislative leaders from red states and battleground states will hold a conference call with reporters to discuss how (candidate last)' name on top of the ticket will benefit state and local (PARTY NAME) candidates in down-ballot races. and on monday, several of (candidate last)' u.s. congressional supporters from red and battleground states will hold a call to discuss how only (candidate last) will help them maintain and expand the (PARTY NAME) majorities in both houses of congress. </p><p>"i am proud to have been among the first elected officials in oregon to support (candidate full) for president," said oregon senate president pro tem margaret carter. "(candidate full) has the most comprehensive plans for transforming america and the best chance of winning here in oregon and in every part of the country." </p><p>"the american people are tired of being ignored by the folks in washington. the people who want real change in this nation don't just live in blue states or in swing states – they live in every state in this country and on every street in america," said (candidate last). "i am committed to spreading a message of real change in every single state in this country. as the (PARTY NAME) nominee, i will go to the places like columbus, kentucky that politicians usually ignore and i will work to get (PARTY NAME) elected to congress, governorships and state legislatures all across this country." </p><p>in addition, the (candidate last)' campaign website, www.(candidate full).com, also launched a new feature – a blue-starred banner that runs at the top of every page and re-directs those who click on it to a page that asks them to support the campaign for a "true blue majority" by contributing one dollar for each state in which (candidate last) has promised to campaign as the (PARTY NAME) nominee --"50 states, $50." </p><p></p><h4>some of (candidate last)' key elected supporters from red states and battleground states include: </h4> <p><b>congressional supporters</b> </p><p>u.s. rep. raul grijalva (az)<br/> u.s. rep. bart stupak (mi)<br/> u.s. rep. jim oberstar (mn)<br/> u.s. rep. g.k. butterfield (nc)<br/> u.s. rep. bob etheridge (nc)<br/> u.s. rep. brad miller (nc)<br/> u.s. rep. mel watt (nc) <br/> u.s. rep. mike mcintyre (nc)<br/> u.s. rep. david price (nc)<br/> u.s. rep. heath shuler (nc) <br/> u.s. rep. stephanie herseth sandlin (sd) <br/> u.s. rep. eddie bernice johnson (tx) <br/> u.s. rep. charlie gonzales (tx)<br/> u.s. rep. david obey (wi)<br/> former u.s. rep. / former ca senate president john burton (ca)<br/> former u.s. rep. ed jenkins (ga)<br/> former u.s. rep. ben "cooter" jones (ga) <br/> former u.s. rep. ken lucas (ky)<br/> former u.s. rep. david bonior (mi)<br/> former u.s. rep. eva clayton (nc) <br/> former u.s. rep. bob weygand (ri)<br/> former u.s. rep. chris bell (tx)<br/> former u.s. rep. max sandlin (tx) </p><p><b>statewide supporters</b> </p><p>ca board of equalization chair betty yee <br/> nd agriculture commissioner roger johnson<br/> ok labor commissioner lloyd fields<br/> va (PARTY NAME) party chair dick cranwell<br/> wi (PARTY NAME) party chair joe wineke<br/> wi state treasurer dawn marie sass <br/> former ga governor roy barnes<br/> former ga lt. governor mark taylor <br/> former ga (PARTY NAME) party chair david worley <br/> former in (PARTY NAME) party chair robin winston<br/> former in (PARTY NAME) party chair anne delany <br/> former ky (PARTY NAME) party chair bill garmer<br/> former ma attorney general scott harshbarger<br/> former mo lt. governor joe maxwell <br/> former nj governor / nj senate majority leader dick codey <br/> former nm attorney general patsy madrid <br/> former nd agriculture secretary sarah vogel <br/> former nd public service commissioner bruce hagen<br/> former nv (PARTY NAME) party chair richard "tick" segerblom <br/> former tx (PARTY NAME) party chair charles soechting <br/> former wi governor tony earl </p><p><b>state legislative leaders</b> </p><p>ca assistant president pro tem leland yee<br/> ga senate dem. leader robert brown<br/> ga house dem. leader dubose porter <br/> in house majority whip dennis oxley <br/> in house majority leader russ stillwell <br/> me senate president beth edmonds <br/> me senate asst. majority leader john martin <br/> mn house asst. majority leader aaron petersen <br/> mn house majority leader tony sertich<br/> mo house dem. whip connie johnson <br/> mo house dem. caucus chair ed wildberger <br/> nd senate minority leader david o'connell <br/> nd house minority leader merle boucher<br/> nj senate deputy majority leader joe vitale <br/> ok senate president pro-tem mike morgan <br/> ok house (PARTY NAME) leader danny morgan<br/> or senate president pro-tem margaret carter<br/> or house speaker jeff merkley<br/> tx house (PARTY NAME) leader jim dunnam<br/> tx mexican-american legislative caucus vice chair trey martinez-fischer<br/> tx legislative study group chair / former tx legislative black caucus chair garnet coleman<br/> va house (PARTY NAME) leader ward armstrong<br/> former ca assembly speaker / l.a. city councilmember herb wesson<br/> former ca assembly majority leader mike roos<br/> former nv senate majority leader joe neal<br/> former oh senate leader c.j. prentiss<br/> former tn house majority whip mike mcdonald<br/> former wi house majority leader david travis<br/> former mi senate minority leader mike hanley</p></span>
