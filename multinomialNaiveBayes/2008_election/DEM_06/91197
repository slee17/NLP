<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – senator (candidate full) released the following statement on today's vote on the peru trade deal in the u.s. house of representatives: <p>"for decades, our leaders in washington have pursued trade policies that have devastated communities like the ones i grew up in. take nafta – it was supported by insiders from both political parties, but it has cost us more than 1 million jobs. now, at a time when american families are terribly concerned about job losses and a weak economy, our congress is about to vote on expanding the nafta-free trade model to peru. </p><p>"the peru deal will continue the trade policies that have long failed our workers and cost american workers their jobs. it's time to show some guts and backbone, stand up and oppose this trade deal, and demand trade policies that put families and workers first. i urge members of congress to vote against this deal today. </p><p>"the fact that the peru trade deal is supported by a bipartisan group of insiders, including george bush and senior officials from the first (candidate last) administration – many of whom are now lobbyists, corporate lawyers, and business consultants – should be proof-positive of why members of congress should join with me and oppose this deal. the benefit to corporate lobbyists from both sides of the political aisle will come only at the expense of hard-working families. </p><p>"senator (candidate last) has chosen to support this bad deal. i strongly disagree with his position, but at least he has taken one. senator (candidate last), on the other hand, has refused to take any position. i urge senator (candidate last) to publicly announce, today, her opposition and join with me in encouraging members of congress to vote against the peru trade deal."</p></span>
