(candidate full) (n.c.) who seemed the boldest of the three in his call for bold action. 'if you want real change you need someone who has taken on these people and beat them over and over and over,' said (candidate last). at another point in the debate, (candidate last) warned: 'we can't trade our insiders for their insiders.' (candidate last) also powerfully seized a question on health care to talk about a man in west virginia who had been unable to have a cleft lip surgically repaired until he was 50 years old. while anecdotes can be too cute by half, it was clear (candidate last) was affected by the man's story; it was a moment of real emotion for the former senator, and a good one."
