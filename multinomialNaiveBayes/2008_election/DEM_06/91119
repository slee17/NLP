<span class="displaytext"><b>chapel hill, north carolina</b> – today, senator (candidate full) released the following statement in support of the striking uaw workers: <p>"i offer my strong support to the striking auto workers and look forward to a fair and speedy settlement that will improve the lives of these hard-working uaw members. and i call on general motors to do what is right and realize that it has a responsibility to negotiate fairly and move quickly to settle a contract that respects the health, safety and economic security of the auto workers and their families. i also salute the courage of the auto workers to go on strike. their fight for fair wages, safe workplaces, affordable health care and a secure retirement helps raise standards for workers all across america. </p><p>"sadly, the issues on the bargaining table between general motors and the united auto workers are not unique to detroit – they represent the larger failures of washington and public policies that have weakened unions and the middle class. the truth is now, more than ever, it's time for america to go in a new direction and start doing much more to strengthen america's unions and protect the rights of working americans."</p></span>
