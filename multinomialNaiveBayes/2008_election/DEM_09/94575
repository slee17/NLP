"part of that is increased border enforcement with smarter technology and more guards. that is a workable solution. you know what will not work? a wall. i think that senators (candidate last), (candidate last), and (candidate last) were wrong to vote to build a wall between the united states and its neighbors. </p><p>"they talk about change, but they voted for the most blatant example of an old-style washington solution-- expensive, dumb, and entirely the product of political calculation." </p><p>the centerpiece of (candidate last)'s policy is a return to engagement with latin america, including troublesome regimes like cuba. </p><p>"as president, i will allow unimpeded family visits and remittances by cuban-americans to their relatives in cuba," (candidate last) said.
