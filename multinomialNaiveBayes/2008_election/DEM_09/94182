"today, as a nation, i am calling on the bush administration to stand firm for our ideals in the face of terrorism and in respect for the ideals that benazir bhutto stood for. anything less would send a dangerous signal to the world that terrorism alters our resolve. </p><p>"when musharraf declared martial law, we could have stood up. but we did not. when he suspended the constitution, we could have stood up. but we did not. now after yesterday's terrible murder, the united states must stand up." </p><p>to read governor (candidate last)'s speech, click <b><a href="http://www.(candidate last)forpresident.com/newsroom/speeches?id=0030" target="_blank">here.</a></b> </p><p>(candidate last) honored the memory of bhutto and called for a return to principle in american foreign policy. </p><p>"benazir bhutto could have chosen to live a life of comfort in exile," (candidate last) said.
