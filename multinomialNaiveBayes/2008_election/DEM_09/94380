<span class="displaytext">santa fe, nm -- today, governor (candidate full) released the following statement regarding gay lesbian bisexual &amp; transgender pride month: <p>"i am very pleased to join my friends in the glbt community and americans across the country in celebrating pride month. this month is a deserved commemoration of the contributions of glbt americans to the united states and a welcome symbol of how far we have come as a nation. </p><p>"we must also acknowledge that we are in the midst of a difficult struggle for basic human rights and we have a long way to go. this month is a worthy symbol of our progress towards full civil rights for every american, but we cannot ignore the challenges we still must conquer before we can truly move forward and create a better society. </p><p>"i have been a strong, dedicated, and proud supporter of the glbt community throughout my time in public service. in congress, i voted against the pentagon's "don't ask, don't tell" policy. i continue to believe that it is wrong, shamefully wrong. this policy is not only detrimental to glbt americans, it is harmful to the security of every american, as badly-needed military personnel are discharged for no other reason than that they are gay or lesbian. </p><p>"as governor of new mexico, i have led the charge for equality in my state. we expanded anti-discrimination laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity. we provided state health insurance for domestic partnerships. and i signed into law the state's first hate crimes legislation for crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identity. i have fought hard for a domestic partner rights act in new mexico and i will not stop fighting until the legislation is passed. </p><p>"as president, i will not rest until we have fulfilled america's most basic promise -- that every human being is created equal and that every american is due certain basic, inalienable rights. i know that until the human rights of every american are guaranteed, the rights of all americans are demeaned."</p></span>
