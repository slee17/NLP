<span class="displaytext"><h3>(candidate last) pleased (candidate last) agrees with his approach to fighting terrorism, but cautions threats must not replace diplomacy</h3><p>santa fe, nm -- (PARTY NAME) presidential candidate new mexico governor (candidate full) released the following statement in reaction to senator (candidate full)'s terrorism speech today: </p><p>"i consistently have said that we need to focus on al qaeda and the taliban, including in <a href="http://www.(candidate last)forpresident.com/newsroom/speeches?id=0016">a major policy address i delivered last week</a> on this very subject. i am glad that senator (candidate last) agrees with me, although i disagree with his plan to leave troops in iraq indefinitely. we still would be militarily overextended. </p><p>"the problem here is that the bush-cheney administration has acceded to general musharraf's deal that has given al qaeda and the taliban a safe haven in pakistan. we need to reverse the bush-cheney policy of appeasement and make sure musharraf knows his deal with the terrorists is completely unacceptable to the u.s. </p><p>"my international experience tells me that we should address this problem with tough diplomacy with general musharraf first, leaving the military as a last resort. it is important to reach out to moderate muslim states and allies to ensure we do not unnecessarily inflame the muslim world."</p></span>
