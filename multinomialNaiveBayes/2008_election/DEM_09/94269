<span class="displaytext">manchester, nh-- (PARTY NAME) presidential candidate governor (candidate full) today responded to comments made by senator (candidate full) in regard to a potential terrorist attack against the united states. <p>according to the associated press, senator (candidate last) yesterday said: "it's a horrible prospect to ask yourself 'what if? what if?' but if certain things happen between now and the election, particularly with respect to terrorism, that will automatically give the (PARTY NAME)s an advantage again, no matter how badly they have mishandled it, no matter how much more dangerous they have made the world. so i think i'm the best of the (PARTY NAME) to deal with that as well." </p><p>"we shouldn't be thinking about terrorism in terms of its domestic political consequences, we should be protecting the country from terrorists," said governor (candidate last). "senator (candidate last) seems to think that president bush has made this country safer. i disagree with her. our failed policy in iraq is making us less safe. our ports are less safe. our cities are less safe. our transportation systems are less safe. george bush is cutting funding to first responders. america's alliances are in disarray because of this president. we need someone with an international record of accomplishments to rebuild strong american international leadership to keep americans safe. i am prepared to stand up to the gop on national security because i've been there and done it. i've been in the negotiating rooms. i've faced the dictators. i've brought hostages and service men home. i've broken an impasse on north korean nuclear facilities. i was instrumental in bringing the north koreans to the table and getting this deal to shut down the nuclear reactor in place. i've got more international experience than the all gop candidates combined."</p></span>
