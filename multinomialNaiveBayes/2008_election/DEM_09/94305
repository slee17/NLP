<span class="displaytext">santa fe -- governor (candidate full) today praised a new study that shows substantial academic gains for children attending new mexico's pre k program. the study showed that the pre k initiative had a meaningful impact on children's early language, literacy and mathematical development as they entered kindergarten. <p>"this is great news for the thousands of new mexico families that now have the opportunity to send their children to quality pre k programs," governor (candidate last) said. "i encourage the legislature to fully fund this program so we can continue to expand access to pre k for every four-year-old." </p><p>the study, conducted by the national institute for early education research at rutgers university, focused on randomly selected four-year-olds attending pre k programs and randomly selected kindergarten students who previously attended pre k programs. additional studies will be conducted each fall to detail the estimated effects of the new mexico pre k initiative in the future. </p><p>the study showed that new mexico's pre k program: </p><ol> <li>increased children's vocabulary scores of nearly 8 raw score points -- 54 percent more growth over the year due to the program. </li> <li>increased children's math scores by about 2 raw score points -- 40 percent more growth over the year due to the program. </li> <li>increased children's print awareness by nearly 26 percentage points -- more than doubling growth over the year due to the program. </li> </ol> <p>"i'm proud that the new mexico pre-k initiative is helping our children succeed -- and does so in a way that is voluntary and allows parents to choose the program that's right for their family," said lt. governor diane denish. "because more than 80 percent of pre-k participants are hispanics and native americans, this greatly increases their access to early childhood learning and ensures that every child has brighter hopes for a diploma, a college education and a good job." </p><p>the nieer study, which was required in the law that created the pre k program, was paid for by the new mexico department of finance and the pew charitable trusts. </p><p>governor (candidate last) worked with the legislature in 2005 to create the pre k program, which is designed to eventually provide access to high quality pre-kindergarten to every family that wants it. about 1,500 four-year-olds had access to state-funded pre k during the first school year, in 2005-06. the program was expanded to reach about 2,200 children during the 2006-07 school year.</p></span>
