and </p><p>whereas, although subprime mortgage lending may have contributed to increased home ownership rates in recent years, there is widespread concern that subprime mortgage lending and the expansion of the secondary mortgage market have enabled unsound lending practices, including excessive fees, pre-payment penalties, and loans to borrowers on terms that are exceedingly difficult to meet during periods of market downturn; and </p><p>whereas, the high interest rates, poor credit history of borrowers, and higher likelihood of default characteristic of subprime loans make such loans particularly risky for certain first time homebuyers and for residents of new mexico who already face financial difficulties; and </p><p>whereas, a comprehensive analysis of the effects of subprime mortgage lending would be of substantial benefit to the citizens of new mexico. </p><p>now therefore, i (candidate full), governor of the state of new mexico, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the constitution and the laws of the state of new mexico, do hereby establish the governor's task force on mortgage lending (“task force”) as follows: </p><p>1.    the purpose of the task force shall be to examine the consequences of subprime mortgage lending in new mexico, to review the home loan protection act, nmsa 1978, §§ 51-21a-1 et seq., homebuyer counseling, financial literacy education, and licensing requirements for originators, and to consider the effectiveness of plain language underwriting and more detailed disclosure requirements. </p><p>2.    the governor shall appoint the membership of the task force so as to ensure a broad representation of the following communities: </p><p>a.     the banking, finance, and mortgage professions; </p><p>b.    the real estate profession; </p><p>c.     the homebuilding profession; </p><p>d.    the legal profession; </p><p>e.     new mexico government; and </p><p>f.      the general public. </p><p>3.    the new mexico mortgage finance authority shall provide administrative staff and support to the task force. </p><p>4.    the term of each member shall be from the date of appointment until twenty (20) days after the adjournment of the next regular session of the legislature in 2008, unless otherwise determined by the governor. </p><p>5.    the task force shall convene at least three times, but may convene as frequently as necessary to accomplish the objectives of the task force. </p><p>6.    the task force shall consult with public and private individuals, experts, and other entities as deemed necessary for the development of its recommendations. input from the general public in the development of any proposals is strongly encouraged. </p><p>7.    the task force shall prepare and present recommendations for the governor's consideration no later than october 31, 2007, unless otherwise directed by the governor.</p><p>8.    the task force shall be an advisory body that makes recommendations to the governor and in no event shall it make final decisions regarding policy.</p><p>9.    task force members shall serve voluntarily and shall receive no pay for their services, nor shall they be reimbursed for travel or subsistence expenses, unless otherwise provided by law. </p><p>this order supersedes any other previous orders, proclamations, or directives in conflict. this executive order shall take effect immediately and shall remain in effect until such time as it is rescinded by the governor. </p><p>attest:                                               done at the executive office this </p><p>                                                                      30th day of august, 2007 </p><p>mary herrera                                witness my hand and the great seal </p><p>secretary of state                           of the state of new mexico </p><p>                                                                      (candidate full) </p><p>                                                                      governor</p></span>
