<span class="displaytext">santa fe, nm-- new mexico governor and (PARTY NAME) presidential candidate (candidate full) today released a statement in support of the joshua omvig veterans suicide prevention act, a bill sponsored by senator tom harkin and congressman leonard boswell. joshua omvig was a soldier from iowa who took his own life after returning from service in iraq. <p>"this bill is a positive and necessary step toward finally giving our veterans the care, treatment, and respect they deserve but have been denied by the bush administration. </p><p>"too many veterans simply do not get the treatment they deserve. the bush administration has fallen short in its treatment of veterans who have been physically wounded and maimed; it has ignored altogether veterans who suffer from mental illnesses stemming from war service. these unseen mental wounds are just as harmful to the health of our veterans as physical injuries. </p><p>"our brave veterans have fought the enemy abroad; they should not have to fight their government at home to get the treatment they deserve. when i am president, our veterans will be able to get the high quality treatment they need. i will drastically improve the va hospital system, and i will create a heroes' health card so that veterans can receive care whenever and wherever they want. </p><p>"tom harkin's leadership on this issue in the senate was essential to its passage. i encourage the house of representatives to follow the leadership of congressman boswell and pass this bill. then, for our veterans' sake, hopefully president bush will see the error of his ways and sign the bill into law."</p></span>
