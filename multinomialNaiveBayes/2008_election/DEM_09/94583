"he is out in front of the other candidates on pay equity and a caregiver credit in social security. he is the only major candidate who supports comprehensive paid family leave that does not depend on the state where one lives. he also is the only candidate who explicitly has stated that he will not appoint judges to the supreme court who do not consider roe v. wade settled law. in short, the best candidate for women is a man-- (candidate full)." </p><p>the national issues conference was created in 1993 to provide its members with access to national leaders and to train them in organizing and fundraising. another major focus is to foster greater participation in women's outreach activities on behalf of (PARTY NAME) presidential and congressional candidates. </p><p>deputy secretary trujillo described the conference and why governor (candidate last) was such an attractive candidate to the attendees. </p><p>"the (candidate last) for president campaign was very strong at this summit for (PARTY NAME) women on the national level," trujillo said. "people were excited about the kind of caliber we have in our group. our campaign's surrogates were the only ones who looked like america. </p><p>"people were talking about how important the western states will be in the next election. the governor's experience is a key selling point. he has done so much already and brings a lot to the table. he does not need a presidency 101; he just can roll up his sleeves and get to work on rebuilding our country." </p><p>the conference was the most recent demonstration of the swelling support for the (candidate last) for president campaign in the washington, d.c. metropolitan area. earlier this month, governor (candidate last) spent two days in the region to campaign, fundraise, and deliver a major policy address on iraq and defense modernization at georgetown university.</p></span>
