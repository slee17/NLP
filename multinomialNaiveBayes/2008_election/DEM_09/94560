"oil is over $90 a barrel. we spend $300 billion a year buying and defending foreign oil, at least ten times more than my program would cost. in the past fifteen years, we have had two big wars in the oil-rich middle east. we also are dangerously heating the climate. </p><p>"my plan would create jobs and improve our security. we can restore our technological, economic, and global leadership. we can inspire the world, solve problems, and create a new energy economy. america is ready. we can help american businesses and american households to make the change, but we must act boldly and act now."</p></span>
