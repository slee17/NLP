"senators (candidate last) and (candidate last) will leave tens of thousands of non-combat troops in iraq without protection and for an unspecified period of time. my position is simple: get all of our troops out. (candidate last), (candidate last), and (candidate last) all would leave tens of thousands of troops in iraq indefinitely. i would get all of our troops out in a matter of months, not years." </p><p>at wednesday's (PARTY NAME) presidential debate at dartmouth university in hanover, new hampshire, iraq dominated the conversation. moderator tim russert asked the candidates if they would commit to pulling out all of our troops by 2013. (candidate last), (candidate last), and (candidate last) all refused to do so. </p><p>"this war already has gone on for too long-- four and a half years," (candidate last) said. "(candidate last), (candidate last), and (candidate last) all are willing to extend the iraq war for another five years. it is absurd. if congress does not end this war now, the next president must do so. i will." </p><p>also on wednesday, governor (candidate last) began airing an ad in new hampshire that emphasizes his iraq plan and its fundamental difference with the plans of the other major candidates. he also released a four-minute video on monday detailing the (candidate last) plan for iraq.

"we cannot begin the hard work of diplomacy until all of our troops are out of iraq. the other candidates may have their paid experts. i am an expert. as america's ambassador to the united nations, i spent eighty percent of my time on the middle east. i negotiated with saddam hussein and returned home with american hostages. what i know is this: we have to get all of our troops out of iraq and leave no residual forces behind." </p><p><b>join (candidate full)'s campaign to end the iraq war. go to: <a href="http://action.(candidate last)forpresident.com/page/m/q3wp3wxy34l/wogeef" title="http://www.getourtroopsout.com/">http://www.getourtroopsout.com/</a></b> </p><p><b>to watch governor (candidate last)'s video "the choice on iraq," click <a href="http://action.(candidate last)forpresident.com/page/m/q3wp3wxy34l/ytuhhn" title="http://action.getourtroopsout.com/page/content/thechoiceoniraq/">here.</a></b> </p><p><b>to watch governor (candidate last)'s new ad "long enough," click <a href="http://action.(candidate last)forpresident.com/page/m/q3wp3wxy34l/7wmb9r" title="http://action.getourtroopsout.com/page/content/ads/longenough/">here.</a></b></p></span>
