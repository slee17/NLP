<span class="displaytext"><h3>war funding should be limited to appropriations necessary to achieve a quick and safe withdrawal of all our forces </h3><p>santa fe, nm -- governor (candidate full) released the following statement today regarding reports that george bush will request an additional $50 billion in iraq war funding.</p><p>"the only appropriation congress should pass for this war is funding for a safe and quick withdrawal. this congress was elected to end the war in iraq. they need to stand up to president bush and do the job. this is an issue where leadership means no compromises. it took us too many years and far too many lives to end the war in vietnam, and we cannot repeat that mistake.</p><p>"congress should use every power at its disposal to end this war, including de-authorization and refusing to fund the war beyond what is necessary for the safe redeployment of our troops.</p><p>"george bush should show less concern about his legacy and pay more attention to the lives of our men and women in harm's way. the best way to support our troops is to get them all out of iraq as soon as it can safely be accomplished.</p><p>"this administration miscalculated the intelligence before the war, mismanaged the war itself, bungled the surge, and now has the audacity to ask congress for more funding to continue this tragic misadventure. the answer should be a resounding no."</p></span>
