"they have been true leaders in the peace and justice community in iowa and across the country for the past 25 years. i am pleased that they recognize that i am the only major candidate who will get all of our troops out of iraq and leave behind no residual forces. they understand, like i do, that we cannot start a war with iran. we must promote more diplomacy, not more conflict. they also understand that, in order to protect our nation from the threat of global terrorism, we must work together with the world community to address poverty, hunger, aids, and the lack of educational opportunities that plague developing nations." </p><p>star*pac invited all of the presidential candidates from both parties to participate in candidate forums and to submit replies to candidate questionnaires. governor (candidate last), senator (candidate last), senator (candidate last), and (candidate full) participated in individual candidate forums or meetings hosted by star*pac, and star*pac received candidate questionnaires from governor (candidate last), senator (candidate last), (candidate full), and representative dennis kucinich. </p><p>iowa's star*pac chair harold wells cited (candidate last)'s iraq position as the primary reason behind the group's endorsement. </p><p>"governor (candidate last) consistently has promised to get all of our troops out of iraq within one year, and probably as soon as six months," wells said. "he promises that he will leave no residual troops behind. his message is the same wherever he speaks-- to a military audience in georgetown, a new hampshire town meeting, in a rural iowa community or at star*pac's candidate forum with the governor in august. three generals-- general volney warner, general william odom, and lt. general robert gard-- support (candidate last)'s plans to get the troops out of iraq." </p><p>"i am deeply committed to raising america's standing in the world," governor (candidate last) said. "i believe, as star*pac does, that america must be a global leader. i am honored to have star*pac's support, and they will be a great voice to help spread my message across the state of iowa." </p><p>"for many of us, the most important thing is that (candidate full) is highly qualified and has a depth of experience not easily matched," said chuck day, long-time star*pac leader and national chair. "he has served as u.n. ambassador, as a two-term governor, and as energy secretary. he was nominated four times for the nobel peace prize, and he served fifteen years as a u.s. congressman.
