"as two of my top priorities, the renewable energy transmission authority will enable our state to export solar, wind and other renewable energy and further build our high-wage, and high-tech economy, while increasing our usage of renewable electricity further solidifies new mexico's stature as the clean energy state." </p><p>hb 188 is sponsored by representative jose campos and sb 418 is sponsored by senator michael sanchez.</p></span>
