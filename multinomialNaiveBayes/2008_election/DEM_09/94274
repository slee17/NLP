"i respect and support iowa's and new hampshire's rightful places as the first caucuses and first primary, respectively, in the nation, and i call on my fellow (PARTY NAME) candidates to do the same. we'll deal with the remainder of the calendar when the dust settles." </p><p>governor (candidate last) is also concerned that the scramble for early dates will negatively impact the nevada caucuses scheduled for january 19th. </p><p>"the nevada caucuses for the first time give the west a critical voice in the selection of the president," said the governor.
