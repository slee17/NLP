<span class="displaytext">new york, ny-- new mexico governor and (PARTY NAME) presidential candidate (candidate full) today released the following statement on the ongoing strike by the writers guild of america: <p>"i support the writers in their strike for a fair deal. new mexico has taken the lead nationally in offering significant incentives to curb the number of productions leaving the country and to keep united states productions here. as a result, we have become a leader in production volume outside of california and new york. so of course we are watching this situation closely. </p><p>"while i hope for a quick resolution to this strike in order to avoid any long-term impact on both the production community and the general public, i also recognize that the issue here is complex: how to distribute equitably the revenues generated from emerging distribution sources such as dvds and the internet. i am confident that all of the parties involved will see that it is in their mutual interest to come to a fair resolution sooner rather than later. the pot certainly is big enough for everyone. </p><p>"plus, i do not want stephen colbert to have any second thoughts about getting out of the race."</p></span>
