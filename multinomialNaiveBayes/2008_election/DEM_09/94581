<span class="displaytext">guthrie center, ia-- in response to u.s. attorney general nominee michael mukasey's refusal to say whether waterboarding is torture, new mexico governor and (PARTY NAME) presidential candidate (candidate full) this morning issued the following statement: <p>"waterboarding is torture, and anyone who is unwilling to identify it as such is not qualified to be the chief legal officer of the united states of america. if i were in the u.s. senate, i would vote against mukasey unless he denounces such specific forms of torture. </p><p>"torture does not work. mistreatment backfires and destroys our international leadership, as we saw with abu ghraib. torture also endangers our own troops. the standards we adopt may well be what our own troops are subjected to. </p><p>"anytime one makes a person think he or she is being executed, the very nature of waterboarding, it obviously is a violation of the u.s. constitution, international law, and basic human decency. </p><p>"abc news has described waterboarding as follows: 'the prisoner is bound to an inclined board, feet raised and head slightly below the feet. cellophane is wrapped over the prisoner's face, and water is poured over him. unavoidably, the gag reflex kicks in, and a terrifying fear of drowning leads to almost instant pleas to bring the treatment to a halt.' </p><p>"if another nation engaged in waterboarding against american citizens, we would denounce that country and call the practice barbaric, and rightly so. </p><p>"we must stand against torture without equivocation, without compromise, and without exception. torture is a violation of everything we stand for as americans and as human beings."</p></span>
