<span class="displaytext"><h3>"(candidate full), the only heavy-weight in bout for (PARTY NAME) nomination"</h3><p>santa fe, nm-- the conway daily sun has endorsed new mexico governor (candidate full) for president, calling him "the only heavy-weight" in the (PARTY NAME) race. </p><p>in their endorsement, the sun writes: "(candidate last) has heavyweight credentials for a heavyweight job; (candidate last), (candidate last) and (candidate last), by comparison, have barely found their way into the ring." </p><p>the sun cites (candidate full)'s successful tenure as governor, comparing his track record to that of new hampshire governor john lynch. </p><p>"like our own gov. john lynch, (candidate last) is a big hit in his home state, where he is considered one of the nation's most environmentally-conscious governors. in new mexico, he has raised the minimum wage, given all children under 5 access to health insurance, cut taxes and is pro-business." </p><p>with the sun's endorsement, (candidate full) becomes the first (PARTY NAME) outside of senators (candidate full) and (candidate full) to earn the support of a new hampshire newspaper. </p><p>the conway daily sun endorsement follows: </p><h3>(candidate full), the only heavy-weight in bout for (PARTY NAME) nomination</h3> <p>sen. (candidate full), a contender for the (PARTY NAME) presidential nomination, said in a recent interview that if it weren't for iowa and new hampshire, the candidate with the most money would always win. </p><p>retail politics works. and it's not overstating it to say that because n.h. voters see, hear and meet the candidates in person, we are better informed than voters in the rest of country, who rely primarily on electronic media. </p><p>the result: n.h. voters often pick winners, and if not winners, candidates who, in hindsight, should have won. how much better off would the (PARTY NAME) party-and the united states-be today if the rest of the country had followed new hampshire eight years ago and elected </p><p>sen. (candidate full)? </p><p>in 2000, the sun was the only newspaper in new hampshire to endorse (candidate last) in the (PARTY NAME) primary. in 2004, we supported gen. wesley clark over sen. john kerry in the (PARTY NAME) primary. granted, neither won, but we feel as good about those selections today as we did then. </p><p>we live in a world where russia's leader may rewrite his country's constitution to maintain power, and where violence is often the political tool of choice, as in much of the middle east. it is remarkable, and a testament to the strength of this country, that the next leader of the free world understands the real power of this country is in its people, and the path to the white house includes running the gauntlet at little n.h. newspapers like the sun. </p><p>the editorial staff of the sun is extraordinarily fortunate to have had exclusive access to the candidates. without handlers at their sides or the national media butting in, most of the candidates have given our eight writers and editors an hour to engage in freewheeling question-and-answer exchanges. </p><p>our staff takes seriously its bit part in selecting the next president. it is impossible to completely discount the "electability" factor and screen out mainstream media, but each of us weighs heavily what we observe in these editorial board interviews. </p><p>in our opinion, this year's (PARTY NAME) are stronger than we've ever seen, and out of three that we believe could be good presidents, we endorse n.m. gov. (candidate full). </p><p>it boils down to this: sen. (candidate full) and former sen. (candidate full) are clearly highly principled people of integrity, and in another race the sun would have supported one of them. </p><p>while (candidate last) and (candidate last) have the big media budgets, neither has the experience of (candidate last). and as for (candidate full), this is what fringe candidate and straight-talking former sen. mike gravel says. </p><p>"the (candidate last)s should read the constitution, eight years is all they get." </p><p>a handful of years as senator for each of them simply does not stack up to (candidate last)'s powerful resume as a former congressman, energy secretary, u.n. ambassador, and now, governor of new mexico. </p><p>like our own gov. john lynch, (candidate last) is a big hit in his home state, where he is considered one of the nation's most environmentally-conscious governors. in new mexico, he has raised the minimum wage, given all children under 5 access to health insurance, cut taxes and is pro-business. </p><p>on the national level, his experience negotiating with bad boys like saddam hussein, fidel castro and the north koreans is world-renowned. (candidate last) gained the reputation as pres. bill (candidate last)'s top international troubleshooter, and during the '90s humorously referred to himself as the "undersecretary of thugs." his success as a negotiator also earned him four nominations for the nobel peace prize. </p><p>(candidate last) has heavyweight credentials for a heavyweight job; (candidate last), (candidate last) and (candidate last), by comparison, have barely found their way into the ring. </p><p>the knock against (candidate last) is that he doesn't have the dynamic personality of ronald reagan or bill (candidate last), although in person he's funny and engaging. asked about this rap and to compare himself to bill (candidate last), (candidate last) says, "yes, (candidate last) can electrify a room, but i can get it done." we're convinced he can, and we ask you to join us in voting for him. </p><p>to learn more about (candidate last), read the albuquerque journal's comprehensive series on his life and career at <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/(candidate last)"><b>www.abqjournal.com/(candidate last)</b></a>.</p></span>
