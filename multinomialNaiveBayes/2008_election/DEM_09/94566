"i would get rid of no child left behind. i believe we need to focus on the future. look, the reality on the electability issue is that the last senator who was elected president was 40 years ago. his name was john f. kennedy. we elect governors as presidents. seven out of the last eight have been either governors or ex-governors. my view is that i know how to bring people together. more important than all of the issues that we are talking about is: who can govern? who can manage? i am the only ceo in this race. i have balanced budgets. i have provided health care to kids under twelve. i have improved education. i have foreign policy experience. i have negotiated with foreign countries as a diplomat and as a hostage negotiator." </p><p>on the topic of energy, governor (candidate last) showed that he has the most comprehensive and specific plan to address the issue of energy in the united states. </p><p>"we need an energy revolution that does the following: reduces the consumption of fossil fuels and establishes fuel efficiency standards of 50 miles per gallon," (candidate last) said. "of all the electricity in america, have at least 30% produced from renewable sources. reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2040 and by 30% by 2020. we need a cap and trade system. we have to ask the american people to sacrifice a little bit. what does that mean? that means: when we use appliances, mass transit, or air conditioning, we all should come together to reduce this dependency on foreign oil that affects our national security. when 65% of your oil is imported, when the planet is polluted by fossil fuels and manmade pollution, we need american leadership and presidential leadership to create an energy revolution." </p><p>as the only major presidential candidate to make education a key issue on the campaign trail, governor (candidate last) made his position clear. </p><p>"compared to countries like china and india, there is a competitiveness gap here," (candidate last) said.
