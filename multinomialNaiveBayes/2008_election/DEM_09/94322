<span class="displaytext">washington, d.c.-- new mexico governor and (PARTY NAME) presidential candidate (candidate full) today issued the following statement on the marine corps' request to shift out of iraq and into afghanistan: <p>"it is unprecedented in our nation's history for the marine corps to ask for permission to leave one war in order to fight another. although defense secretary gates has rejected marine corps commandant general james conway's proposal, perhaps the bush administration should take note of the real meaning of this request: that one of america's military services formally has requested leave from president bush's failed iraq policy. </p><p>"general conway has the right idea. the real threat to america is the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11, and they are based on the afghan-pakistani border. we need to withdraw all of our forces from iraq-- leaving behind no residual troops-- and redouble our efforts in afghanistan. </p><p>"our troops have done everything that has been asked of them and more. they deserve to leave iraq with honor, and they deserve to begin leaving today. nearly five years into this war, the death of one more american troop is one too many."</p></span>
