<span class="displaytext">governor (candidate full) today urged americans to watch tomorrow's (PARTY NAME) presidential debate, saying it will help move the primary discussion from a media popularity contest to an honest discussion of issues and experience. the debate is scheduled for tomorrow at 7 p.m. edt in south carolina. <p>"this will be the first chance for americans to see all of the (PARTY NAME) candidates together and to see who is the most qualified and best prepared to be president on day one," said governor (candidate last). "we won't be debating the poll numbers, we'll be debating and stating our opinion on real issues, and people will see a difference. there are important differences in the qualifications and accomplishments of the candidates. they'll see that i would get our troops out of iraq, all of our troops, with no residual forces. i've been there, i know the region, and i know our presence is no longer helping. they'll see that i believe we can provide universal health coverage for all americans without raising taxes. in new mexico i expanded access to health care while cutting taxes. they'll see how i plan to help the american middle-class prosper, and how i believe we can improve our schools and give every child the opportunity to go to college or vocational school. this is the best and brightest field of (PARTY NAME) candidates ever, but there are real differences that people need to know before they make up their minds."</p><p>the debate is being held at south carolina state university in orangeburg, south carolina. it will be broadcast live on msnbc on thursday from 7-8:30 p.m. edt. it will also be shown live on msnbc.com.</p></span>
