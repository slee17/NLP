<span class="displaytext">santa fe, nm -- (PARTY NAME) presidential candidate governor (candidate full), while on a peace-promoting mission to sudan in january raised concerns about reports of widespread rape in darfur and the need for a complete analysis of the situation. as a result, refugees international traveled to sudan to study the issue further and 'laws without justice' is the report from that mission. <p>"when i met with president omar al-bashir in january i raised my concerns about reports of widespread rape in darfur. president al-bashir denied that rape was a significant problem and urged us to go to the sudanese ministry of justice for briefings on sudan's program for dealing with rape. that wasn't good enough -- i knew that what was really needed was a comprehensive analysis of the situation in order to understand how to solve this injustice. </p><p>"i commend refugees international on this report; it is an important contribution to the efforts to reduce rape in darfur. it analyzes sudan's laws governing rape and recommends a number of changes to strengthen protections for women and to reduce the impunity currently given to many rapists. this analysis provides a valuable starting point for sudanese civil society groups working to reform the rape laws. </p><p>"the war in darfur continues, and extensive rape is one of the unfortunate tragedies of that fighting. sudan's recent acceptance of a hybrid peacekeeping force is one of the steps i urged president al-bashir to take. but he must do more, he must now follow through on his pledge to allow the hybrid force into sudan and he must begin negotiations toward a comprehensive peace agreement in darfur. as in the past, i stand ready to do all i can to promote peace in darfur, once i see a good faith commitment from all parties to pursue a peace process."</p><p><a href="http://action.(candidate last)forpresident.com/page/-/documents/20070628_lawswoutjustice.pdf">click here for a copy of the report.</a></p></span>
