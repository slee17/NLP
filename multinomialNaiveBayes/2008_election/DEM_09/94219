<span class="displaytext">washington, d.c.-- new mexico governor (candidate full) today issued the following statement on president bush's nomination of michael mukasey as the next attorney general of the united states: <p>"the next attorney general must restore integrity and credibility to the department of justice and be an independent protector of the constitution, not a political arm of the white house. the department of justice has routinely rubber-stamped policies that go against established legal precedent and undermine the rule of law. morale is low and highly-qualified professionals are leaving because they are not allowed to do their jobs properly. </p><p>"i look forward to judge mukasey's confirmation hearings to learn more about his views on privacy, counterterrorism, and the balance of powers. </p><p>"today i pledge to the american people that when i am elected president, i will appoint an attorney general with strong credentials and a record of independence. furthermore, unlike this president, i pledge that all of the judges i nominate to the bench will have earned a rating of 'well qualified' from the american bar association. i strongly urge my fellow candidates to pledge the same."</p></span>
