<span class="displaytext">washington, dc-- new mexico governor (candidate full) issued the following statement today regarding president bush's veto of the schip legislation passed by congress: <p>"the grinch came three months early this year and stole children's health care. unfortunately, this is no fairy tale, and unless congress overrides the president's veto, it will not have a happy ending. </p><p>"president bush's veto is irresponsible. it is outrageous. it is simply immoral. of the many shifting rationales the president has offered for vetoing this bill, one is that it will burden private insurance companies. that sums up everything we need to know about this president. choosing between insurance companies and children should not be hard. </p><p>"this bill is morally and fiscally responsible. it pays for itself with a cigarette tax right now. it will save us money over the long run by getting poor children the treatment they need when they need it, rather than forcing them into overstrained, costly emergency rooms. </p><p>"i strongly urge congress to do the right thing and override the president's veto."</p></span>
