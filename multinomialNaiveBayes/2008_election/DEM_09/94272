<span class="displaytext"><h3>(candidate last) says the surge has failed and again calls for us to withdraw all troops with no residual forces</h3><p>reno, nv -- governor (candidate full), campaigning in nevada, today released a statement in response to a speech by president bush comparing a withdrawing of u.s. forces from iraq to america's withdrawal at the end of the vietnam war. </p><p>"the correct conclusion to draw from our experience in vietnam," said governor (candidate last), "is that dragging out the process of withdrawal will be tragically worse in terms of u.s. lives lost and worse for the iraqi's themselves in terms of the ultimate instability we will create by staying longer." </p><p>in 1968 nixon ran on a platform of ending the war with honor. it took 7 years to get the last american soldier out of vietnam. in the meantime, tens of thousands more americans died. the costs in terms of tragedy in southeast asia itself are a matter of historical record. millions of civilians ultimately died in vietnam, in cambodia and the killing fields and millions more ultimately had to flee their homes. </p><p>"we have now been in iraq longer than it took to win world war ii," governor (candidate last) continued. "my plan for iraq is designed to end this war with the least possible number of u.s. casualties and with the least damaging effects of iraqi's reconciliation process. this means getting all of our troops out as quickly and safely as possible. leaving residual troops in iraq as (candidate full), (candidate full) and (candidate full) have suggested will only drag out the process to the detriment of all involved. reconciliation can only occur when the u.s. has completely withdrawn. everyday, more and more experts are coming to the same conclusion i drew seven months ago. my position has been consistent and unwavering. a fast, safe withdrawal with no residual troops." </p><p>in addition, governor (candidate last) reiterated his belief that the so-called "surge" in u.s. forces in iraq has been a failure, and responded to senator (candidate last)'s change of heart regarding the lack of progress in the war. </p><p>"i am pleased that senator (candidate last), today, recognizes that the surge has produced no progress of any long term significance to the iraq debacle. that is different from what she said yesterday to the veterans of foreign wars. but, it is that audience, who has sacrificed more than any of us, who deserves to hear a clear statement that our sons and daughters and mothers and fathers are not going to be sacrificed because of an irrational commitment to a failed strategy. </p><p>the president is asking the country to wait for next month's progress report from general petraeus. the chances are that report will be just another white house spin job and attempt to justify this war. this has been the bloodiest summer yet -- our troops have done an admirable job at trying to make a bad idea work, but the surge has failed, the war has failed, bush has failed. it is time to end this war and bring all of our troops home as soon as possible. i'm glad (candidate full) has retracted her comments yesterday and has declared the surge a failure today -- but i still haven't gotten an answer to my question -- a peace in iraq will fail as long as we leave troops behind -- how many would you leave behind? every other major candidate would leave thousands of us troops in iraq for an indefinite. i will leave no u.s. forces there. zero. </p><p>the only way out of the iraq mess is to remove all u.s. troops, and to use that leverage to get the warring parties to resolve their differences, and surrounding muslim nations to help stabilize the country. any residual u.s. force reduces the chances for success, and exposes our troops as targets. our brave troops, and the american people, deserve better."</p></span>
