"this war is a quagmire. we have to get all of our troops out now. no more politics." </p><p>the governor was frustrated by the lack of time devoted to exploring the candidate's positions on the iraq war, and other critical topics. "if we had more time we could have had a real discussion so people could see my plan is clearly different than the other candidates."</p><p>governor (candidate last)'s strong performance impressed a focus group of undecided voters in nevada, who told cnn that the governor was one of the winners in tonight's debate. the group used dial technology that rates positive or negative input from users on a graph. the strongest positive reaction from the nevada focus group, and the audience attending the debate in charleston, came when governor (candidate last) responded to a question about whether he would keep or do away with the bush administration's no child left behind program.</p><p>"i would scrap it. it just doesn't work," said governor (candidate last). "the worst thing it does is it takes districts and schools that are not doing well, takes their funds away and penalizes them. if a school is not doing well, we help that school. </p><p>"the key to a good education in this country is a strong teacher. i would have a minimum wage for all our teachers, $40,000 per year, and i would emphasize science and math."</p><p>governor (candidate last) also staked out his plan to restore us leadership around the world, helping to stop the genocide in darfur, responding to homeland emergencies such as hurricane katrina, and providing universal health care to all americans. </p><p>the questions for the debate were submitted on video by users of youtube, a social networking internet site. many were presented in clever, unique ways. </p><p>"governor (candidate last) clearly enjoyed hearing questions from people, not journalists or pundits and his strong performance reflected that," said dave contarino, (candidate last)'s campaign manager. </p><p>(candidate full) has spent more than 25 years in public service: as a seven-term congressman, us ambassador to the united nations, secretary of energy, and as two-term governor of new mexico.</p></span>
