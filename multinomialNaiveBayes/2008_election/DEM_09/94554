<span class="displaytext">washington, dc-- new mexico governor and (PARTY NAME) presidential candidate (candidate full) today released the following statement urging congress to pass the employment non-discrimination act (enda): <p>"this should be a no-brainer for congress: enda is an essential piece of civil rights legislation that has taken too long-- thirteen years-- to get to this point. it is hard to believe that we even have to debate prohibiting discrimination of any kind. </p><p>"i applaud congressman barney frank for his tireless efforts in advancing the cause of equality and justice. however, let us be clear-- the struggle for equality is not over. i am disappointed, as i know congressman frank is, that gender identity is not protected in today's bill. that must be fixed. </p><p>"in my first year as governor of new mexico, i expanded anti-discrimination laws to include sexual orientation. i also signed into law new mexico's first hate crimes legislation, which included acts based on sexual orientation, and i issued an executive order extending state health insurance benefits to all domestic partnerships. as president of the united states, i will fight for those same protections and rights for every american. </p><p>"enda is a pivotal step toward equal treatment under the law for every american. along with my friends in the lgbt community, i look forward to the day when this no longer is an issue, when discrimination of any kind is not tolerated, and when we can celebrate our diversity as a nation and the protection of every american's civil rights."</p></span>
