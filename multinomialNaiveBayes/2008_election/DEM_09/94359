<span class="displaytext"><h3>administration clearly thinks it is above the law</h3><p>santa fe, nm -- new mexico governor (candidate full) today issued the following statement regarding president bush commuting the sentence of lewis "scooter" libby, who was convicted on federal charges of perjury, obstruction of justice, and lying to investigators. </p><p>"it's a sad day when the president commutes the sentence of a public official who deliberately and blatantly betrayed the public trust and obstructed an important federal investigation," said governor (candidate last). "this administration clearly believes its officials are above the law, from ignoring fisa laws when eavesdropping on us citizens, to the abuse of classified material, to ignoring the geneva conventions and international law with secret prisons and torturing prisoners. </p><p>there is a reason we have laws and why we expect our presidents to obey them. institutions have a collective wisdom greater than that of any one individual. the arrogance of this administration's disdain for the law and its belief it operates with impunity are breathtaking. </p><p>will the president also commute the sentences of others who obstructed justice and lied to grand juries, or only those who act to protect president bush and vice president cheney?"</p></span>
