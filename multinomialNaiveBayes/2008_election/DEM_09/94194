<span class="displaytext"><h3>despite today's rhetoric, (candidate last) remains the only major candidate who will get all of the troops out and end the war</h3><p>washington, dc-- new mexico governor and (PARTY NAME) presidential candidate (candidate full) today released the following statement on (candidate full)' new rhetoric on iraq: </p><p>"when asked directly by tim russert if, as president, he would pledge to have all american troops out of iraq by 2013, (candidate full) said no. he could not commit to ending this war even in five and a half years. we need less rhetoric and more resolve on this issue. </p><p>"(candidate last) says that he would get all of the combat troops out of iraq, but he would leave behind thousands of non-combat troops in the middle of a civil war. that is not ending the war. just look at what he has said-- look at the plan on his web site. if you leave thousands of troops behind, you are not ending the war. </p><p>"leaving behind thousands of non-combat troops contradicts army doctrine and common sense. it is simply irresponsible. furthermore, (candidate last)' plan to keep a brigade in iraq for five years for humanitarian workers and civilian contractors is equally mistaken. five thousand troops will not be able to do what he is asking. history teaches us that putting undermanned forces in the middle of sectarian conflict, whether in somalia, lebanon, or anywhere else, is a recipe for disaster. </p><p>"in his speech today, (candidate last) tried to widen the rhetorical distance between himself and senator (candidate last). however, the actual difference in this race is between me and senators (candidate last), (candidate last), and (candidate last). they will leave thousands of our brave troops behind. i will get all of them out and leave behind no residual forces. (candidate full) would change the mission. i will end the war."</p></span>
