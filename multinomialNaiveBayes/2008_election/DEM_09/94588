"we're especially excited that more than 22,000 people contributed $200 or less- our grassroots support is growing and those donors can contribute more going forward." </p><p>governor (candidate last) is the only major candidate calling for the united states to withdraw all troops from iraq with no residual forces. "that message is resonating with voters across the country and is a real point of difference," added ms. cooper. "the other major candidates would all leave thousands of residual troops in iraq for years- they won't even commit to ending the war by the end of their first term. governor (candidate last) would get all us forces out of iraq by the end of his first year in office." </p><p>the governor has also proposed comprehensive plans to make the us energy independent, to provide universal health coverage for all americans, and to dramatically improve the nation's education system. </p><p>having served as a congressman, us ambassador to the united nations, secretary of energy, and now as two-term governor of new mexico, (candidate full) has a real record of accomplishment and offers both the change and experience america needs in its next president.</p></span>
