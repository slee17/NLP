the nation would lose in iraq. the (PARTY NAME) party, particularly senator (candidate last) in the primary, built a political strategy around losing -- gaining from a loss in iraq. senator (candidate last) risked his political career to make sure the nation did not lose in iraq. so, senator (candidate last) completely misunderstood what needed to be done, early on, and continues to misunderstand the importance of winning in iraq. for us to deny history does a great disservice for those who made history. the history that's being made in iraq now, from the surge, came at a heavy prince and a lot of sacrifice. and, i want i want it to be clear that from this campaign's view -- from my view -- senator (candidate last)'s rhetoric, from january 2007 all through the surge, made it much more difficult. if we had followed his counsel and advice, iraq would have crumbled, al-qa eda would have claimed victory, iran would be the biggest winner of a destabilized, fractured iraq. now, for anybody to say that the surge has not worked would be an affront to those who brought about success. ...</p><p>"and if we started to pullout one to two brigades a month and announce it now, it could jeopardize all the gains that we have made. it would reset the clock in iraq. it would take an enemy that's on its knees and give them some hope they're back in the fight. that would be the worst thing you could do as an american political leader, commander-in-chief, is to arbitrarily announce that we are going to pull out the troops out in 16 months, beginning one or two brigades a month.</p><p>"and to say that senator (candidate last) has not advocated such a position is just rewriting history. this is what he said september '07, after general petraeus testified: 'so let me be clear, there is no military solution in iraq.' let me stop there. he was wrong. there was a military solution. we needed more combat power to bring about security that would result in economic and political progress, which it has done. economic progress in iraq and political progress is stunning. and he says there never was. 'the best way to protect our security and pressure iraqi leaders to resolve their civil war is to me to immediately begin to remove our combat troops, not in six months, or one year, but now.'</p><p>"so the bottom line is from january of '07 to september, all the way up to the present, senator (candidate last) has been advocating a strategy that would have resulted in a fractured, broken iraq. a country in chaos, that would have been a major loss in the greater war on terror, and would have hurt our international security interests in the region and throughout the world."</p><p><b>kori schake:</b> "not only was senator (candidate last) mistaken about the nature in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, he's also fundamentally mistaken about the nature of the insurgency now and about how to counter it. senator (candidate last) seems to believe that threatening iraqis with abandonment is the way you create an environment to encourage them to make brave political choices, and that's just not right. the reason the surge has worked is because it has created an environment, with us as a trusted partner, and the iraqis increasingly taking responsibility for political developments and for security developments. nine of 18 provinces are now with iraqi leadership in control and us supporting. the extraordinarily good work done by iraqi political leaders and iraqi security forces in basra, in mosul, in sadr city are a demonstration that by being a trusted par tner with the iraqis that they can and will make positive change securing their country and securing our interests. and, the strategy that senator (candidate last) lines out in his editorial piece would not only bring that to an end, it would corrode it, and it demonstrates a fundamental lack of judgment about how to win the war in iraq and about how to prosecute the war in afghanistan."</p><p><b>randy scheunemann:</b> "senator (candidate last)'s confusion on iraq continues and the contradictions within his own op-ed in the new york times today make it clear that the american people should remain puzzled about what his position actually is. his daily refinements announced in advance to his first trip to iraq in 918 days, as if his mind is already made up, lead one to question why he is even bothering to go.</p><p>"senator (candidate last) put forward a strategy as senator graham outlined to turn this war around and to win, senator (candidate last) continues to search for a political position that will protect his flank in an election. senator (candidate last) said he would rather lose an election than lose a war and see the nation lose a war. senator (candidate last) seems to think that losing a war will help him win an election. in january 2007, he said the surge wouldn't work. today, he recognizes the surge has reduced violence, protected iraqis and diminished al-qaeda, but he then goes on to say he still opposes the surge. does he think this turnaround would of still happened without the surge and the change in strategy? he selectively quotes in his op-ed today lt. general dulik as saying iraqis would be ready to assume responsibility for security in 2009, yet his next sentence says 'only by redeploying troops can we press the iraqis to achieve a successfu l transition to taking responsibility for their security'. so which is it? is it on track and going to happen or does it need redeployment to enforce it? in the new york times today senator (candidate last) said his residual force would 'so long as iraqis make political progress, train iraqi security forces'. what does this mean? would he stop training iraqi forces if the hydrocarbon law isn't passed, when he's conditioning training on political progress.</p><p>"also in his op-ed today, senator (candidate last) falsely claimed that senator (candidate last) was backing off a commitment to respect the sovereign will of the iraqi government. this is shameful. i hope senator (candidate last) gets a chance to talk with that sovereign government when he goes to iraq. i hope he asks prime minister maliki whether he supports the surge. i hope he asks the prime minister and the government whether they believe that american forces are 'babysitting a civil war', which is how (candidate last) characterized the conflict last year. i hope he asks the government whether they believe that the support provided in the surge enabled the sovereign government not only to survive, but to undertake political reconciliation.</p><p>"let me make one more point about senator (candidate last) position in reference to afghanistan. in may 24, 2007, he joined only 13 other senators to oppose $94.4 billion in supplemental funding for iraq and for afghanistan. it included $295 million to protect army helicopters from shoulder launched missile in iraq and afghanistan, $314 for road building in afghanistan, $174 million provincial reconstruction teams in afghanistan, $25 million for governance programs in afghanistan, $3 billion for mine resistance ambush protected vehicles, mraps, $1.6 billion for body armor, $9.7 billion for training and equipping afghan and iraqi security forces. this is senator (candidate last)'s judgment on display, defund our forces in afghanistan and iraq in an effort to placate the left-wing of the (PARTY NAME) party. this vote was an exercise in political irresponsibility and senator (candidate last) should explain why he voted that way, why he wanted to strand our brave men and women in afghanistan and iraq when they are fighting al-qaeda terrorists. senator (candidate last) is not trying to have it both ways, he's trying to have it every way on the hope that his contradictions will be ignored by the media and the american people. he says he wants to win in afghanistan but he votes against the money to do it. he's never said he wants to win in iraq. he said he wants to withdraw from iraq and he said that if he's president he will order his commanders to withdrawing and this has the effect of being an unprecedented order from a commander-in-chief if he gives it to general petraeus and general odierno ordering them to lose a war they are on the way to winning."</p><p><i><b><a href="http://blip.tv/file/1077574">listen</a> to the full conference call</b></i></p></span>
