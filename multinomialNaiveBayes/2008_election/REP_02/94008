<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full)'s presidential campaign today released the following statement by communications director jill hazelbaker concerning (candidate full)'s announcement that he will not participate in the public financing system: <p>"today, (candidate full) has revealed himself to be just another typical politician who will do and say whatever is most expedient for (candidate full). </p><p>"the true test of a candidate for president is whether he will stand on principle and keep his word to the american people. (candidate full) has failed that test today, and his reversal of his promise to participate in the public finance system undermines his call for a new type of politics. </p><p>"(candidate full) is now the first presidential candidate since watergate to run a campaign entirely on private funds. this decision will have far-reaching and extraordinary consequences that will weaken and undermine the public financing system."</p></span>
