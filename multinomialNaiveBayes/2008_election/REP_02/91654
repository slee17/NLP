(burman et al., "a preliminary analysis of the 2008 presidential candidates' tax plans," the tax policy center, 6/11/08)</li> <li> <b>tax foundation: seniors "rely most on the stable flow of income that dividends provide." </b>"most debate over whether to extend the reduced rates on dividends and capital gains has focused on the tax benefits of these cuts to high-income taxpayers. what has been largely ignored is the impact these tax policies have on corporations' decisions on how best to distribute their income to shareholders--including senior citizens, who rely most on the stable flow of income that dividends provide. a recent tax foundation analysis illustrated that a large number of those benefiting from dividends are seniors and those on the verge of retirement (see <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/1236.html"><u> www.taxfoundation.org</u> </a>). a further analysis of these seniors earning dividends reveals that lower-income seniors who file tax returns depend more heavily on dividend income than high-income seniors."
