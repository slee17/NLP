(candidate full) had the strength and vision to support the surge in iraq, even though it was politically unpopular. he served his country heroically in the u.s. navy, including 5 1/2 years in the 'hanoi hilton,' and throughout his distinguished career, (candidate full)'s many accomplishments have always been marked by bipartisan leadership and a willingness to put solutions above party politics. unfortunately the same cannot be said of (candidate full)'s limited, yet remarkably partisan record."</p><p>(candidate full)'s campaign announced the leadership of california veterans for (candidate full) today at a press event in san diego that featured veterans from numerous wars and branches of the military. alongside the veterans in the energetic crowd in san diego, families with strong military history dating back to world war i came out to show their support for senator (candidate last)'s campaign.</p><p><b><u>california veterans for (candidate full) leadership team</u></b></p><p><b>honorary chairman</b><br/> vice admiral ed martin, usn (ret.), former pow, vietnam war</p><p><b>director</b><br/> chuck mcdougald -- captain, u.s. army special forces, 1964-1969, vietnam war</p><p><b>regional chairs</b><br/> northern california -- larry wahl<br/> san francisco bay area -- bill applegate<br/> central valley -- charlie waters<br/> central coast -- rob bryn<br/> inland empire -- robby hightower<br/> los angeles county -- gabrial groves<br/> san diego county -- bob rubin<br/> orange county -- orange county<br/> imperial county -- tom topuzes<br/></p></span>
