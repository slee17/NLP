(candidate last): "no, no, no, no. what i've said, george, is even if we're still in a recession i'll go through with my tax cuts, that's my priority." stephanopoulos: "but not the increases?" (candidate last): "i think we have to take a look and see where the economy is. the economy is weak right now." (abc's "this week," 9/7/08) </p><p><b>in june, (candidate full) said he may "possibly defer" some of his tax increases based on the economic situation.</b> cnbc's john harwood: "higher taxes for capital gains, for dividends, for carried interest, for high-income americans. you embraced a lot of those policies when the economy was stronger than it is now." (candidate last): "yeah, yeah." harwood: "even if you think those are a good idea substantively, is there reason, because of the situation we're in, to delay the implementation of any of those to avoid having a negative effect on job creation?" (candidate last): "well, there's no doubt that any policies i implement are going to be based on the economic situation that i inherit from george bush. you know, one of the things i believe in is a manager of the economy, is you should base your decisions on facts and not ideology. and so even if i'm predisposed to a certain set of policies, i'm going to want and see what's going on at the moment and ask a wide range of viewpoints from situations..." harwood: "so you can see the possibility of deferring some of those?" (candidate last): "some of those you could possibly defer." (cnbc's "your money, your vote: (candidate last) vs. (candidate last)," 6/10/08)</p></span>
