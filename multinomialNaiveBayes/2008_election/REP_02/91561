"we did not get there alone. as a company we have been able to succeed because we invested in our employees and our business. that is why we support (candidate full)'s pro-growth tax policy of permitting businesses to immediately deduct the cost of equipment and technology so we can continue to grow our business and bring more jobs to colorado. today's challenging economic climate is not the time to burden small businesses with more taxes." </p><p>ann brown, president of news vista enterprises in golden colorado, added, "(candidate full) has put forth an economic plan that will help small business create jobs, while senator (candidate last) is proposing raising taxes on small businesses like ours and voting to increase taxes for coloradoans making as little as $32,000 a year. as a small business owner, the difference could not be more clear and i am proud to support (candidate full) for president." </p><p>today in washington, dc (candidate full) addressed the 79th annual lulac convention where he is discussing how his jobs first plan will help the hispanic community. later this week (candidate full) will travel to ohio, to talk with working families about his plan to create more jobs in america. </p><p><b><u>small business leaders for (candidate last) chairs<br/></u></b>michele austin, president and ceo, square one consulting services, englewood<br/>greg barrow, founder/managing director, general capital partners, denver<br/>ann brown, owner, new vista enterprises, golden<br/>gordon brown,owner, new vista enterprises, golden<br/>george caulkins, principal, greendeck capital, denver<br/>sherry collins, owner, s.d. collins &amp; associates, lakewood<br/>michael eddy, founder/managing director, general capital partners, denver<br/>stephen halliday, president, ling and louie's asian bar and grill, denver<br/>anne mcmahon, president, friend of the family llc, littleton<br/>beth isern, president and ceo, behany manufacturing, nederland<br/>mark johnson, ceo, johnson storage and moving company, centennial<br/>harold smethills, managing director, hill equities, llc, golden<br/>jerrold spaeth, president and ceo, metro denver title, denver<br/>robert spicer, partner, first financial equity corporation, denver<br/>tammy swanson, president, optimum operations, llc, fort collins<br/>frank tijerina, jr.,tijerina &amp; assoc, denver<br/>susan turner, owner, restaurant management of georgia, colorado springs<br/>michael turner, owner, restaurant management of georgia, colorado springs<br/>scott wyatt, ceo, advantage integrated solutions, denver <b><br/></b></p></span>
