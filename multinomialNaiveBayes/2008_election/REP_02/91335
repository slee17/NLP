(candidate last), i thought it would be useful to explain why i am joining a growing number of (PARTY NAME) (including three lifelong (PARTY NAME) state representatives who have endorsed (candidate full) in just the last month) in this state who are uniting to elect (candidate full) as our next president. while (candidate last) talks of putting partisan politics aside, the reality is that his record in the u.s. senate shows he has voted with (PARTY NAME) 97 percent of the time. he has never once taken on the (PARTY NAME) party on even a single issue. </p><p>(candidate full), on the other hand, has never allowed partisan politics and washington political scorekeeping to come before the greater good of what is necessary for this nation. i have seen him time after time rise above the political pettiness in washington politics to get things done for this country to make it more safe, secure and prosperous. he has taken on people in his own party time and time again and has made many in the (PARTY NAME) party leadership upset which, i can tell you as a (PARTY NAME), first caught my attention and showed that will put country over partisanship. </p><p>as a former hillary supporter, i certainly do not agree with (candidate full) on everything; but, what i most like most about (candidate full) is that he has proven continually that we can trust him to do what is right for our country. </p><p>perhaps lifelong (PARTY NAME) joe lieberman said it best when he endorsed sen. (candidate last) by saying, "we desperately need our next president to break through the reflexive partisanship that is poisoning our politics and stopping us from getting things done. we need a president who can reunite our country, restore faith in our government, and rebuild confidence in america's future." </p><p>as a (PARTY NAME) legislator, i appreciate (candidate full)'s relentless efforts to find solutions that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil while increasing our energy security. he knows that we cannot stake our nation's energy supply on the whims of authoritarian leaders in foreign countries like saudi arabia and russia and we must develop alternative energy sources to achieve energy security and greatly reduce our reliance on imported oil. he has been in the forefront on this issue and climate change as well which not many (PARTY NAME)s can say. </p><p>(candidate full) has proven that he has the experience, the courage and the strength of character to be our commander-in-chief from day one. (candidate full), for all of his lofty rhetoric, simply does not and that is probably why you have seen such a shift over the last few weeks in former (candidate full) supporters in new hampshire and a lot of (PARTY NAME) in general to (candidate last). </p><p>if you are like me, you don't agree with (candidate full) on every single issue either, but you know you can always count on him to be honest with you about where he stands and you can rely on him to fight for what he believes is right for our country -- regardless of pressure from politicians, party members, lobbyists or special interest groups. his quick and decisive response to the financial crisis where he suspended his campaign to address the issue in washington is indicative of this. </p><p>we need a president who rises above partisan politics, is a proven leader and someone who can reunite our country, restore faith in our government and return america to prosperity. </p><p>(candidate full) is just that person and i would urge you to vote for him next week. </p><p><a href="http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?articleid=1f035c89-bb6e-4104-87fb-529aefc7228b&amp;headline=rep.+hector+velez%3a+i+am+crossing+party+lines+to+vote+for+john+(candidate last)"><b><i>read</i></b></a> the entire article</p></span>
