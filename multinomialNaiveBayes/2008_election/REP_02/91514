(candidate last) never has been a conventional politician. he thinks for himself and acts on what he believes to be in the best interests of the nation, and not necessarily in the interests of his party or his own political fortunes. in an era of dismaying partisan paralysis in washington, (candidate last) has stood out as a bipartisan force, best illustrated by his collaboration with liberal (PARTY NAME) lion edward kennedy on a comprehensive solution to america's immigration dilemma. </p><p>what's more, (candidate last)'s character has been thoroughly tested, from his pow confinement in hanoi to decades of legislative battles on capitol hill. the same is not true of (PARTY NAME) contender (candidate full), who is intelligent, thoroughly versed on the issues and a truly gifted orator, but one of the least tested men ever to win his party's nomination. </p><p>just as important, a careful examination of the candidates' policies leads us to the firm conclusion that (candidate last)'s call for higher taxes and greatly increased federal spending with a strong emphasis on government redistribution of wealth -- would be debilitating to an already threatened american economy. in contrast, (candidate last)'s drive to reduce the tax burden on both families and businesses, while slashing pork-barrel spending and promoting free trade, is exactly what is required to restore economic growth. </p><p>when the great depression struck in the early 1930s, washington responded with misguided tax hikes and trade barriers that only exacerbated the crisis. today, in the face of renewed economic turmoil of historic proportions, (candidate last) proposes to boost the capital gains levy -- a particularly onerous tax on business expansion and job growth -- and increase the tax rate on dividends, which account for a big chunk of americans' retirement earnings. </p><p>(candidate last) touts his economic policies as providing tax cuts for 95 percent of americans. in truth, he would achieve this only by refunding the social security taxes of the millions of americans who don't make enough to pay income taxes, while imposing even higher rates on wage earners who already pay a disproportionate share of income taxes. thus, (candidate last)'s "share the wealth" thrust would penalize the most productive, job-creating elements of society in order to reward the least productive. this is a political gambit, not sound economic policy. which is why a joint statement from 100 leading economists, including five nobel laureates, declares that (candidate last)'s plans "defy both economic reason and economic experience." </p><p>and what would (candidate last) do? the gop nominee proposes to make all of president bush's tax cuts permanent. this includes maintaining the capital gains levy at the current rate of 15 percent. meantime, he would chop the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent, and broaden business tax deductions for equipment and new technology investments. rather than be a drag on the economy, (candidate last)'s policies would stimulate job creation and growth, the key to healthy government revenues in the long run. </p><p>more than any other member of congress, (candidate last) has mounted a tough assault on earmarks and other wasteful government spending. as a deficit hawk, he would restrain (as president bush deplorably has not) the voracious spending desires of a senate and house firmly in (PARTY NAME) hands. the exact opposite would be the case with (candidate last) in the oval office. the candidate himself has called for hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending programs. combined with a (PARTY NAME) congress, this suggests that today's horrendous deficits could only get uglier -- much, much uglier -- sapping private-sector expansion. </p><p>lastly, (candidate last) and (candidate last) differ sharply on international trade, an issue that is critically important to san diego. as the 100 influential economists note, rising exports have done far more this year to stimulate growth than the phony stimulus package passed by congress. san diego, perched on the u.s.-mexico border and the pacific rim, relies increasingly on global trade. yet (candidate last) would constrain international commerce by "renegotiating" the most successful of all trade pacts, the north american free trade agreement. he also opposes pending trade accords with central america and colombia. (candidate last), on the other hand, has supported every conceivable agreement to reduce the barriers to open international trade. </p><p>on election day, americans historically have voted their pocketbooks. this innate common sense is more important than ever in stormy economic times. at this critical moment, america needs (candidate full) in the oval office. </p><p><a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20081019/news_lz1ed19top.html"><b><i>read</i></b></a><b><i>the editorial</i></b> </p><p><b>"(candidate last) is the best choice for president"<br/>editorial<br/><i>san antonio express-news <br/></i>october 19, 2008</b> </p><p>the united states faces unprecedented economic, security and political challenges. the nation needs a leader with both the judgment and the experience to deal with these challenges. </p><p>that leader is (candidate full). </p><p>(candidate last) brings a proven track record of fighting the bipartisan fiscal irresponsibility that prevails in washington. </p><p>he is a powerful opponent of wasteful earmarks, which the arizona senator properly describes as a "gateway drug" to corruption. there can be no doubt that he would wield the veto pen against the excesses of congress, no matter which party sits in the majority. </p><p>with deficit spending soaring, his dedication to responsible fiscal policy is desperately needed in the white house. </p><p>during his military career and 26 years in congress, (candidate last) has become an expert on foreign policy and security issues. from latin america to the caucasus to the middle east and asia, (candidate last) has intimate knowledge of the issues and the personalities. </p><p>(candidate last)'s understanding of the world and the nation's security needs is a crucial asset in these tumultuous times. </p><p>and few leaders in u.s. history have had more first-hand knowledge of the toll war takes on military personnel and their families. </p><p>with public respect for political institutions residing at or near all-time lows, the american people need a president willing to transcend partisanship and do what is best for the nation. </p><p>only (candidate last) has a record of challenging his own party on key issues such as immigration and global warming. </p><p>on entitlement spending -- the next financial disaster looming on the horizon -- only one presidential candidate is willing to speak the unpopular truth.
