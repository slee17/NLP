<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full) today made the following statement at a media availability in allentown, pennsylvania regarding the conditions of barracks at fort bragg: <p>"obviously, this is an unacceptable situation. i think the most important thing to do initially is for the secretary of defense to conduct a thorough investigation of all barracks that are used by the men and women serving in our military and report to congress any deficiencies or shortcomings that may exist. again, it's one of these things that is so unacceptable that it's shocking. i have some confidence that it will be fixed, but it never ever should have happened in the first place."</p></span>
