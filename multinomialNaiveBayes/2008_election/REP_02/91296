(PARTY NAME) cold warriors like scoop jackson fought against the tide. but despite their principled efforts, the (PARTY NAME) party through the 1970s and 1980s became prisoner to a foreign policy philosophy that was, in most respects, the antithesis of what (PARTY NAME) had stood for under roosevelt, truman and kennedy.</p><p>then, beginning in the 1980s, a new effort began on the part of some of us in the (PARTY NAME) party to reverse these developments, and reclaim our party's lost tradition of principle and strength in the world. our band of so-called new (PARTY NAME) was successful sooner than we imagined possible when, in 1992, bill (candidate last) and al gore were elected. in the balkans, for example, as president (candidate last) and his advisers slowly but surely came to recognize that american intervention, and only american intervention, could stop slobodan milosevic and his campaign of ethnic slaughter, (PARTY NAME) attitudes about the use of military force in pursuit of our values and our security began to change.</p><p>this happy development continued into the 2000 campaign, when the (PARTY NAME) candidate -- vice president gore -- championed a freedom-focused foreign policy, confident of america's moral responsibilities in the world, and unafraid to use our military power. he pledged to increase the defense budget by $50 billion more than his (PARTY NAME) opponent -- and, to the dismay of the (PARTY NAME) left, made sure that the party's platform endorsed a national missile defense.</p><p>by contrast, in 2000, gov. george w. bush promised a "humble foreign policy" and criticized our peacekeeping operations in the balkans.</p><p>today, less than a decade later, the parties have completely switched positions. the reversal began, like so much else in our time, on september 11, 2001. the attack on america by islamist terrorists shook president bush from the foreign policy course he was on. he saw september 11 for what it was: a direct ideological and military attack on us and our way of life. if the (PARTY NAME) party had stayed where it was in 2000, america could have confronted the terrorists with unity and strength in the years after 9/11.</p><p>instead a debate soon began within the (PARTY NAME) party about how to respond to mr. bush. i felt strongly that (PARTY NAME) should embrace the basic framework the president had advanced for the war on terror as our own, because it was our own. but that was not the choice most (PARTY NAME) leaders made. when total victory did not come quickly in iraq, the old voices of partisanship and peace at any price saw an opportunity to reassert themselves. by considering centrism to be collaboration with the enemy -- not bin laden, but mr. bush -- activists have successfully pulled the (PARTY NAME) party further to the left than it has been at any point in the last 20 years.</p><p>far too many (PARTY NAME) leaders have kowtowed to these opinions rather than challenging them. that unfortunately includes (candidate full), who, contrary to his rhetorical invocations of bipartisan change, has not been willing to stand up to his party's left wing on a single significant national security or international economic issue in this campaign.</p><p>in this, sen. (candidate last) stands in stark contrast to (candidate full), who has shown the political courage throughout his career to do what he thinks is right -- regardless of its popularity in his party or outside it.</p><p>john also understands something else that too many (PARTY NAME) seem to have become confused about lately -- the difference between america's friends and america's enemies.</p><p>there are of course times when it makes sense to engage in tough diplomacy with hostile governments. yet what mr. (candidate last) has proposed is not selective engagement, but a blanket policy of meeting personally as president, without preconditions, in his first year in office, with the leaders of the most vicious, anti-american regimes on the planet.</p><p>mr.
