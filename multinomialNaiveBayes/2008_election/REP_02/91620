<span class="displaytext">arlington, va - (candidate last)-palin 2008 communications director jill hazelbaker issued the following statement on tonight's presidential debate: <p>"tonight, (candidate full) won the debate. he was the only man who demonstrated he had the independence and strength to take on everything that's broken in washington and on wall street. (candidate full) had a clear plan for improving the lives of americansÂ -- keeping them in their homes through his american homeownership resurgence plan. from (candidate full), we heard half-truths and contradictions between what he says and what he has done. he said he supported offshore drilling but has opposed it for months. he talked about tax cuts but he voted for higher taxes 94 times and promises increased taxes on small businesses. he talked about reducing the size of government but has proposed hundreds of billions of dollars in new government spending. tonight, (candidate full) had an opportunity to level with the american people, but instead all we heard was more of the same."</p></span>
