(candidate full) for his proven record of working with both parties to bring about meaningful change in washington. </p><p>(candidate last) has credibility on brokering compromise because he's done it in the senate on climate change, campaign finance reform and preventing individual senators from blocking votes on judicial nominations, said lieberman. </p><p>"i personally appeal to independents in new hampshire to understand that he is the genuine independent in this race for president and the real candidate who has been the change agent,'' said lieberman, who was re-elected as an independent in 2006. </p><p>as for (PARTY NAME) rival sen. (candidate full), lieberman said he's not seen any evidence during four years in office of the (PARTY NAME) nominee disagreeing with the leadership in his own party. ... </p><p>the (candidate last) campaign scheduled a conference call monday on the eve of new york sen. (candidate full)'s return to the state on behalf of (candidate last) and (PARTY NAME) senate candidate jeanne shaheen. ... </p><p>"we are looking forward to a come-from-behind victory in new hampshire,'' lieberman said. ... </p><p>lieberman campaigned in the state two days last week and spent a lot of time stumping for (candidate last) in the runup to (candidate last)'s presidential primary victory last january. </p><p>(candidate last) had considered lieberman as a running mate, the position that (PARTY NAME) presidential nominee al gore gave lieberman in 2000. lieberman said he still is a (PARTY NAME) but said the party's leadership has veered too far off centrist politics since that election. </p><p>"on the economy, trade, national security and government reform, the (PARTY NAME) party is not what it was eight years ago,'' lieberman said. </p><p>as for what issue will make a difference in the final week, lieberman said it's that enough voters will conclude that while a skillful campaigner, (candidate last) lacks the readiness for the job. </p><p>"a day may come when i would be supporting senator (candidate last) for president but not in this race,'' lieberman added. </p><p><a href="http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20081028/news02/310289965/-1/news"><b><i>read</i></b></a><b><i>the entire article</i></b></p></span>
