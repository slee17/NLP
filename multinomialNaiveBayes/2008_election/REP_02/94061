<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, in virginia, (candidate full) committed malpractice by accusing (candidate full) of trying to cut medicare services and benefits. nothing could be further from the truth. check out (candidate full)'s top medicare lies below: <b><u> </u></b><p>(candidate last) medicare malpractice #1: the very same reforms that (candidate full) calls "cuts" under (candidate full), he says will "strengthen" medicare under his program  </p><p>the malpractice: while saying today that (candidate full)'s reforms will "cut" medicare spending, (candidate full) says he will "strengthen" medicare with his reforms. (candidate last):<b>"so what would senator (candidate last)'s cuts mean for medicare at a time when more and more americans are relying on it? it would mean a cut of more than 20 percent in medicare benefits next year. ... i think every single american has a right to affordable accessible health care. we can strengthen medicare by eliminating wasteful subsidies to big hmos in medicare, and making sure seniors can access home-based care, and letting medicare negotiate with drug companies for better prices. that's the kind of change we need." ((candidate full), remarks as prepared for delivery, roanoke, va, 10/17/08) <b> </b></b></p><p>the truth: just two days ago, (candidate full) highlighted his own "cut" to medicare spending. (candidate last): "and some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies. it doesn't -- under the medicare plan -- it doesn't help seniors get any better. it's not improving our health care system. it's just a giveaway." (cnn, presidential candidate debate, hempstead, ny, 10/15/08) <b> </b></p><p>the truth: one such "cut" that (candidate full) must support under (candidate full)'s logic is a reform that today, (candidate full) said would "strengthen" medicare. (candidate last): "government programs such as medicare and medicaid should lead the way in health care reforms that improve quality and lower costs. medicare reimbursement now rewards institutions and clinicians who provide more and more complex services. we need to change the way providers are paid to focus their attention more on chronic disease and managing their treatment. this is the most important care for an aging population. there have been a variety of state-based experiments such as cash and counseling or the program of all-inclusive care for the elderly, called pace, that are different from the inflexible approaches for delivering care to people in the home setting. seniors are given a monthly allowance that they can use to hire workers and purchase care- related services and goods. they can get help managing their care by designating representatives, such as relatives or friends, to help make decisions. it also offers counseling and bookkeeping services to assist consumers in handling their programmatic responsibilities. in these approaches, participants were much more likely to have their needs met and be satisfied with their care. moreover, any concerns about consumers' safety appeared to be misplaced. for every age group in every state, participants were no more likely to suffer care-related health problems." ((candidate full), remarks, tampa, fl, 4/29/08) <b><u> </u></b></p><p>(candidate last) medicare malpractice #2: (candidate full) implies <i>the</i> <i>wall street journal</i> reported (candidate full) plans to "cut" medicare by $882 billion -- the number is not reported by <i>the journal</i> but made up by the (candidate last)-supporting center for american progress  </p><p>the malpractice: today, (candidate full) implied that <i>the wall street journal </i>reported (candidate full) plans to "cut" medicare by $882 billion. (candidate last): "but the wall street journal recently reported that it's actually worse than we thought. it turns out, senator (candidate last) would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in medicare -- $882 billion worth. $882 billion in medicare cuts to pay for an ill-conceived health care plan, even as medicare already faces a looming shortfall." ((candidate full), remarks as prepared for delivery, roanoke, va, 10/17/08) <b> </b></p><p>the truth: (candidate full) is basically citing his own campaign because the report comes from the liberal-leaning, (candidate last)-supporting center for american progress. "sen. (candidate full) (r-az) disclosed this week that he would cut $1.3 trillion from medicare and medicaid to pay for his health care plan. ...the (candidate last) plan will cut $882 billion from the medicare program, roughly 13 percent of medicare's projected spending over a 10-year period." (peter harbage, karen davenport and ellen-marie whelan, "(candidate last)'s latest health care strategy," center for american progress, 10/7/08) <b><u> </u></b></p><p>(candidate last) medicare malpractice #3: (candidate full) accuses (candidate full) of not being forthcoming about his health care plan just one day after his own campaign refused to answer questions about his plan  </p><p>the malpractice: today, (candidate full) said that (candidate full) has not shared all the detail of his health care plan. (candidate last): "senator (candidate last) has been eager to share some details of his health care plan -- but not all. like those ads for prescription drugs, you have to read the fine print to learn the full story." ((candidate full), remarks as prepared for delivery, roanoke, va, 10/17/08) <b> </b></p><p>the truth: just yesterday, the (candidate last) campaign said that it had "no plans" to detail how much of a fine small business not offering health insurance would have to pay under the (candidate last) health care plan. "as the presidential candidates push their competing health-care plans, sen. (candidate full) regularly presses sen. (candidate full) to tell voters how big a fine he would impose on companies that don't offer their workers health insurance. ... (candidate last) officials say the campaign has no plans to answer that question before election day on nov. 4. neera tanden, a top (candidate last) policy adviser, said the fine is intended to discourage employers from dropping coverage, not to raise significant revenue." (laura meckler, "(candidate last) presses (candidate last) on health-plan penalties," <i>the wall street journal</i>, 10/16/08) <b> </b></p><p>the truth: (candidate full)'s plan has "little" to say about the "immediate challenge" of taming the "soaring costs of medicare and medicaid." "while senators hillary rodham (candidate last) and (candidate full) fight over who has the better health plan for the uninsured, they say little about a more immediate challenge that will confront the next administration, whether (PARTY NAME) or (PARTY NAME): how to tame the soaring costs of medicare and medicaid." (robert pear, "about those health care plans by the (PARTY NAME)," <i>the new york times</i>, 3/3/08) <b> </b></p><p>the truth: (candidate full) has "not focused on the dour forecast for today's workers who hope someday to be enrolled in medicare." "(candidate last) and (candidate last) have also said they would raise the current income tax rates on upper-income people to help pay for offering insurance to younger and middle-aged americans who now have none. but their health insurance rhetoric has not focused on the dour forecast for today's workers who hope someday to be enrolled in medicare."
