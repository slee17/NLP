(candidate last) would nominate justices who believe the constitution means what it says. (candidate last) would appoint justices who just make it up as they go along. </p><p>finally, it is still a dangerous world out there, which the current financial crisis can make us forget. there are people out there who wish us harm and have the ability to cause it. of all the candidates who sought the presidency this year, (candidate last) stands alone as the one best able to handle that danger. he has the ability to make the tough calls and the judgment to handle the unforeseen crisis. </p><p><a href="http://www.news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20081028/editorial/810280320"><b><i>read</i></b></a> the editorial</p></span>
