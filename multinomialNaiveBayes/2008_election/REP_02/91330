(candidate last)-the-maverick has reverted to party orthodoxy on taxes and other issues this year, which will put him in a bind if elected: would he stick with those new positions, or compromise with the (PARTY NAME) congress he'd likely be working with? </p><p>as (candidate last) points out on the campaign trail, (candidate last) has a much thinner record of bucking his own party. with the exception of tough fights for ethics reforms in the illinois senate and in washington -- where he angered (PARTY NAME) colleagues by insisting on the disclosure of lobbyists who bundle campaign donations -- (candidate last) has rarely challenged party dogma on the sort of big, contentious issues he'd face as president. as a u.s. senator, he has taken liberal (PARTY NAME) positions on most issues. studies by congressional quarterly show (candidate last) has voted with his party almost 97% of the time, vs. about 85% for (candidate last). </p><p>where (candidate last) has diverged, it has often been rhetorical and reactive: after securing the nomination, he expressed disagreement with a supreme court decision that struck down the death penalty in cases of child rape, and he approved a decision that overturned a strict gun control law in washington, d.c. he has signaled support for a modified form of affirmative action (extending it to poorer whites and denying it to better-off african americans), and he has supported a key bush initiative that funnels federal dollars to faith-based groups. </p><p>(candidate last)'s bipartisan accomplishments in washington have been on significant, but relatively non-controversial, efforts to secure nuclear weapons and establish a federal-spending database. what he lacks is a record of challenging his own party on divisive, difficult issues -- the deficit, immigration, energy -- that he'd have to reach out to (PARTY NAME)s on if he's elected. even with a (PARTY NAME) majority in congress, it takes 60 votes in the senate to pass most major measures. </p><p>none of this is to say (candidate last) couldn't turn into a consensus-building, party-challenging president. based on their records so far, though, it takes a greater leap of faith to believe that of him than of (candidate last). </p><p><a href="http://blogs.usatoday.com/oped/2008/09/whos-the-better.html/lmore"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the editorial</p></span>
