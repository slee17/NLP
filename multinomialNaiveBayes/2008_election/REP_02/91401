(candidate last) may one day be able to point to a similar record of achievement, but the plain fact is that he has served barely more than half of one term in the senate. he is an eloquent speaker with great promise as a future leader. </p><p>but we also see in (candidate last) someone who shares the bedrock positions of the press-gazette -- that the government that governs least governs best, that the best tax relief occurs when government spends less, that the american dream is within reach to anyone willing to put in the necessary hard work and commitment. </p><p>and that, finally, is why we support (candidate full) for president. </p><p><a href="http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/article/20081024/gpg0602/81024125/1269/gpg06"><b><i>read</i></b></a> the editorial</p></span>
