<span class="displaytext"><b>(candidate last) support rally behind their candidate in racine</b><br/> by michael burke<br/> racine journal times<br/> july 31, 2008<br/> <a href="http://www.journaltimes.com/articles/2008/08/01/local_news/doc48925d4a64240826444937.txt">http://www.journaltimes.com/articles/2008/08/01/local_news/doc48925d4a64240826444937.txt</a><p>with his town hall appearance here thursday, (candidate full) seemed to cement the support of those who came in inclined to vote for him. </p><p>that was the recurring message from those who shared their opinions after the memorial hall event. </p><p>john pettinger, 41, of racine called himself a (candidate last) supporter going in to the event. "i was more or less impressed," he said. the videos about (candidate last) that showed before the live event were effective, he said. </p><p>"i do think he dodged a few of the questions, no doubt about it," pettinger said. </p><p>however, he said (candidate last) "has a real genuineness that i suspected he had, and now i know he has." </p><p>ron ganim, 61, of the chicago area, voiced the same thought. "i thought he came across as a really genuine person," he said. "very honest and forthright." </p><p>ganim also said he thought (candidate last) was articulate. "i was actually a little concerned about that," he said, but thought the candidate handled the town hall part well. </p><p>he said he likes (PARTY NAME) candidate (candidate full) "as a person," but said (candidate last) is "the real mccoy." </p><p>justin emerson, 18 of manteno, ill., also found (candidate last) personable. "i learned a lot. it swayed me more his way," he said. </p><p>emerson also embraced (candidate last)'s call for off-shore drilling and nuclear power. </p><p>"my dad is in the nuclear industry," he said. "energy is really important for our country to succeed." </p><p>renee boyle, 38, of twin lakes said, "his focus on education was important to me. i was interested in what he said about cars and giving people $5,000 to purchase more economical, fuel-friendly cars." </p><p>david ricchio of racine said he was "very impressed. all of his comments are things i would support. i was particularly impressed with his attitude of 'america first.'" </p><p>ricchio especially liked (candidate last)'s stances on reducing spending and pork-barrel spending. </p><p>"he did an excellent job because there were some weird people in the group there obviously with their own agendas that were negative," ricchio said. "(candidate last) handled it in a positive and inspiring way." </p><p>"he's got a patch on his skin, he's 71 or 72," he said. "he's more charismatic in person. i don't know how he's going to address that when (candidate last)'s such a charismatic guy. i don't know how to make people see him how we did." </p><p>seeing (candidate last) in person was enough to get lindsey pohlman, 22, of mchenry, ill., to sign up as a (candidate last) volunteer on her way out of memorial hall. </p><p>"i think people of our age will vote for (candidate last) because it's cool," she said. "... i really don't care if people my age vote for (candidate last) — as long as they have a reason. i don't want to hear that it's just because he's young or a good speaker. </p><p>"i think it's important to have an opinion and to know what you're talking about," pohlman added. </p><p>she said she thinks that (candidate last)'s campaign has generated enthusiasm among young voters — but that there is also now a counter-response developing among young people in (candidate last)'s favor. </p><p>cindy celmer, 49, of racine said she came in a (candidate last) supporter, "but not big supporter." now she's more likely to vote for him. </p><p>"my family's been in the military, and he's been there."</p></span>
