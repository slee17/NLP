(candidate last) is not noted for sticking to a position or a person once that position or person becomes a political liability. (names available upon request.) </p><p>all politicians change their positions, sometimes even because they have changed their minds. (candidate last) must have suffered excruciating whiplash from totally reversing himself on george bush's tax cuts. he has denounced preachers he later embraced and then, to his chagrin, has had to denounce them all over again. this plasticity has a label: pandering. (candidate last) knows how it's done. </p><p>but (candidate last) has shown that in this area, youth is no handicap. he has been for and against gun control, against and for the recent domestic surveillance legislation and, in almost a single day, for a united jerusalem under israeli control and then, when apprised of u.s. policy and palestinian chagrin, against it. he is an accomplished pol -- a statement of both admiration and a bit of regret. </p><p>(candidate last) is often likened to john f. kennedy. the comparison makes sense. he has the requisite physical qualities -- handsome, lean, etc. -- plus wit, intelligence, awesome speaking abilities and a literary bent. he also might be compared to franklin d. roosevelt for many of those same qualities. both fdr and jfk were disparaged early on by their contemporaries for, i think, doing the difficult and making it look easy. eleanor roosevelt, playing off the title of kennedy's pulitzer prize-winning book, airily dismissed him as more profile than courage. similarly, it was walter lippmann's enduring misfortune to size up fdr and belittle him: roosevelt, he wrote, was "a pleasant man who, without any important qualifications for office, would very much like to be president." lippmann later recognized that he had underestimated roosevelt. </p><p>my guess is that (candidate last) will make a fool of anyone who issues such a judgment about him. still, the record now, while tissue thin, is troubling. the next president will have to be something of a political superman, a man of steel who can tell the american people that they will have to pay more for less -- higher taxes, lower benefits of all kinds -- and deal in an ugly way when nuclear weapons seize the imagination of madmen. </p><p>the question i posed to that prominent (PARTY NAME) was just my way of thinking out loud. i know that (candidate full) is a near-perfect political package. i'm still not sure, though, what's in it. </p><p><b><i><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/28/ar2008072802464_pf.html">read</a> the op-ed</i></b></p></span>
