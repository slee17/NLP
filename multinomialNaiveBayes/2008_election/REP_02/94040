<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- one year ago today, (candidate full) said he would personally meet with the leaders of iran and other rogue nations "without precondition." such unconditional presidential summits would undermine the multilateral diplomacy now underway. this one-year anniversary is even more significant given that (candidate full) is in israel which is threatened and attacked by hamas and hezbollah, terrorist groups backed by iran. please find below background on (candidate full)'s support for unconditionally holding presidential summits with foreign dictators and state sponsors of terrorism.<p><b>at a july 2007 (PARTY NAME) debate, (candidate full) announced he would personally meet with leaders of iran, north korea, syria and other hostile nations "without precondition." </b> question: "[w]ould you be willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of iran, syria, venezuela, cuba and north korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries?"... (candidate last): "i would. and the reason is this, that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them -- which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration - is ridiculous."

(candidate last): "yeah, nothing's changed with respect to my belief that strong countries and strong presidents talk to their enemies and talk to their adversaries. i find many of president ahmadinejad's statements odious and i've said that repeatedly. and i think that we have to recognize that there are a lot of rogue nations in the world that don't have american interests at heart. but what i also believe is that, as john f. kennedy said, we should never negotiate out of fear but we should never fear to negotiate."
