</p><p>and that's just the beginning of what (candidate last) would spend. </p><p>fact: the tax cuts he promises, which are mostly refundable tax credits (code for cash back), will cost $60 billion just in year one, according the national taxpayers union, though the (candidate last) campaign's own estimates in july put that figure at $130 billion. </p><p>fact: his new promise to give businesses a $3,000 tax credit for each new job created will cost $40 billion. but economists say this credit is far more likely to benefit companies already planning to expand and will likely not be enough to help companies create new jobs or forestall layoffs. </p><p>fact: (candidate last)'s claim he will lower health care premiums by $2,500 is: 1.) guesswork, which is 2.) based on health care savings that might, in a perfect world, happen over 10 years - a fact (candidate last) neatly glosses over. </p><p>fact: (candidate last), when referring to savings he can make by leaving iraq ($90 billion, according to congressional budget office estimates), has spent these savings several times over, across several different promises depending on the crowd he's addressing. </p><p>most of the time he spends the iraq savings in the context of the roads he wants to build; sometimes it's for the teachers he wants to hire. tonight, he riffed rhetorically on the savings, asking how many scholarships could be funded, or how many schools could be built. in the end though, presuming he really saves $90 billion, he can only spend it once. </p><p>remember he also mentioned rebuilding the military ($7 billion/yr); his education initiative ($18 billion/yr); and his energy initiative ($15 billion/yr). he did not mention the $188 billion that he would spend on the brand new stimulus package he has proposed. </p><p>if he closes every loophole as promised, saves every dime from iraq, raises taxes on the rich and trims the federal budget as he's promised to do "line by line," he still doesn't pay for his list. if he's elected, the first fact hitting his desk will be the figure projecting how much less of a budget he has to work with - thanks to the recession. he gave us a very compelling vision with his ad buy tonight. what he did not give us was any hint of the cold reality he's facing or a sense of how he might prioritize his promises if voters trust him with the white house. </p><p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/29/eveningnews/realitycheck/main4557520.shtml"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the article</p></span>
