<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, the (candidate last)-palin 2008 campaign issued the following statement from u.s. representative lincoln diaz-balart on the (candidate last) campaign's "offensive and dishonest" immigration ad: <p>"it is offensive and dishonest for (candidate full) to lie about (candidate full)'s record on immigration and years of support for the hispanic community, when it was (candidate full) himself who voted for 'poison pill' amendments that killed the effort at immigration reform. instead of making false ads with baseless attacks, (candidate full) should be apologizing to the latino community." <b><u> </u></b></p><p>in case you missed it: "(candidate last)'s new spanish language tv ad es erroneo"  </p><p>from the fact check desk: (candidate last)'s new spanish language tv ad es errneo<br/>jake tapper<br/>abc's political punch blog<br/>september 17, 2008 5:53 pm<br/>http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/09/from-the-fact-1.html </p><p>sen. (candidate full), d-ill., has launched a new spanish-language tv ad that seeks to paint sen. (candidate full), r-ariz., as anti-immigrant, even tying the (PARTY NAME) to his longtime conservative talk-radio nemesis rush limbaugh. </p><p>as first reported by the washington post, (candidate last)'s ad features a narrator saying: "they want us to forget the insults we've put up with...the intolerance...they made us feel marginalized in this country we love so much." </p><p>the screen then shows these two quotes from limbaugh: </p><p>"...stupid and unskilled mexicans"<br/>--rush limbaugh </p><p>"you shut your mouth or you get out!"<br/>--rush limbaugh </p><p>the narrator then says, "(candidate full) and his (PARTY NAME) friends have two faces. one that says lies just to get our vote...and another, even worse, that continues the policies of george bush that put special interests ahead of working families. (candidate full)...more of the same old (PARTY NAME) tricks." </p><p>there are some real factual problems with this ad, which is titled "dos caras," or two faces. </p><p>first of all, tying sen. (candidate last) -- especially on the issue of immigration reform -- to limbaugh is unfair. </p><p>limbaugh opposed (candidate last) on that issue. vociferously. and in a larger sense, it's unfair to link (candidate last) to limbaugh on a host of issues since limbaugh, as any even occasional listener of his knows, doesn't particularly care for (candidate last). </p><p>second, the quotes of limbaugh's are out of context. </p><p>railing against nafta in 1993, limbaugh said, "if you are unskilled and uneducated, your job is going south. skilled workers, educated people are going to do fine 'cause those are the kinds of jobs nafta is going to create. if we are going to start rewarding no skills and stupid people, i'm serious, let the unskilled jobs that take absolutely no knowledge whatsoever to do -- let stupid and unskilled mexicans do that work." </p><p>not one of his most eloquent moments, to be sure, but his larger point was that nafta would mean that unskilled stupid mexicans would be doing the jobs of unskilled stupid americans. </p><p>i'm not going to defend how he said it, but to act as if this was just a moment of limbaugh slurring mexicans is not accurate. though again, certainly if people were offended i could understand why. </p><p>the second quote is totally unfair. in 2006, limbaugh was mocking mexican law, and he wrote: </p><p>"everybody's making immigration proposals these days. let me add mine to the mix. call it the limbaugh laws: </p><p>"first: if you immigrate to our country, you have to speak the native language. you have to be a professional or an investor; no unskilled workers allowed. also, there will be no special bilingual programs in the schools with the limbaugh laws. no special ballots for elections. no government business will be conducted in your language. foreigners will not have the right to vote or hold political office. </p><p>"if you're in our country, you cannot be a burden to taxpayers. you are not entitled to welfare, food stamps, or other government goodies. you can come if you invest here: an amount equal to 40,000 times the daily minimum wage. if not, stay home. but if you want to buy land, it'll be restricted. no waterfront, for instance. as a foreigner, you must relinquish individual rights to the property. </p><p>"and another thing: you don't have the right to protest. you're allowed no demonstrations, no foreign flag waving, no political organizing, no bad-mouthing our president or his policies. you're a foreigner: shut your mouth or get out! and if you come here illegally, you're going to jail. </p><p>"you think the limbaugh laws are harsh? well, every one of the laws i just mentioned are actual laws of mexico today! that' how the mexican government handles immigrants to their country. yet mexicans come here illegally and protest in our streets! </p><p>"how do you say double standard' in spanish? how about: no mas!'" </p><p>but even if one is uninclined to see limbaugh's quotes as having been taken unfairly out of context, linking them to (candidate last) makes as much sense as running a quote from bill maher and linking it to (candidate last). </p><p>asked for backup as to how (candidate last) could link (candidate last) to limbaugh, the campaign provided this interview with (candidate last) refusing to condemn the minutemen from from the kansas city star: </p><p>q: are they a good thing? the civil defense corps, do you think -- do they help in the immigration fight, or not?' </p><p>a: i think they're citizens who are entitled to being engaged in the process. they're obviously very concerned about immigration.' </p><p>q: are they helpful?' </p><p>a: i think that's up to others to judge. i don't agree with them, but they certainly are exercising their legal rights as citizens.' </p><p>asked about the "lies" they're accusing (candidate last) of telling, the (candidate last) campaign provided evidence that (candidate last) in july 2008 told la raza that he would have voted for the dream act, a bill that provides scholarships for the children of illegal immigrants, even thought he earlier in the campaign season said he would have voted against the bill. </p><p>let's delver further into this. </p><p>in the november 2007, myrtle beach sun-news, (candidate last) said of the dream act, which he had cosponsored in the past, "i think it has certain virtues associated with it. and i think other things have virtues associated with it. but the message is they want the borders secured first." </p><p>the newspaper noted that (candidate last) said he'd vote against a temporary worker program, even though he supports the idea. "i will vote against anything until we secure the borders," he said. "there is no way we're going to enact piecemeal immigration reform." </p><p>before la raza, (candidate last) was asked by a young latina if he'd support the dream act, and he said, "yes. yes." </p><p>the full exchange, however, goes like this: </p><p>questioner: hi. i'm a part of one dream 2009 and i am one of the 6 million who either have an undocumented parent or is undocumented and i wanted to know if you would support humanity all around the world and support our dream act that we are trying to pass. </p><p>(candidate last): yes. yes. thank you. but i will also enforce the existing laws of a country. and a nation's first requirement is the nation's security, and that's why we have to have our borders secured. but, we can have a way and a process of people obtaining citizenship in this country. and, we cannot penalize people who come here legally and people who wait legally. and so, that's a fundamental principle on which we have to operate. thank you. </p><p>the (candidate last) campaign also provided a number of conflicting comments (candidate last) has made about offering greater funding for education programs in the no child left behind act, then telling the national association of latino elected and appointed officials in june that he "would fully fund those programs that have never been fully funded," while not suggesting any greater funding for the bill when he's talked about education in front of whiter audiences. </p><p>that ignored the fact that (candidate last) has suggested reallocating the way the $23 bill for nclb is spent. </p><p>(candidate last) has changed his rhetoric and his emphasis when discussing immigration after almost losing the gop presidential nomination because of it. </p><p>he now says the borders must be secured before anything else happens. and in that, he's opened himself up to charges of flip-flopping, though the (candidate last) campaign is quoting him selectively and unfairly to make their points. </p><p>the greater implication the ad makes, however, is that (candidate last) is no friend to latinos at all, beyond issues of funding the dream act or how nclb money is distributed. by linking (candidate last) to limbaugh's quotes, twisting limbaugh's quotes, and tying (candidate last) to more extremist anti-immigration voices, the (candidate last) campaign has crossed a line into misleading the viewers of its new tv ad. in spanish, the word is errneo.</p></span>
