<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full) issued the following statement on recent progress in iraq: <p>"progress between the united states and iraq on a time horizon for american troop presence is further evidence that the surge has succeeded. most of the u.s. forces used in the surge have already been withdrawn. when a further conditions-based withdrawal of u.s. forces is possible, it will be because we and our iraqi partners built on the successes of the surge strategy, which senator (candidate last) opposed, predicted would fail, voted against and campaigned against in the primary. when we withdraw, we will withdraw with honor and victory. an honorable and victorious withdrawal would not be possible if senator (candidate last)'s views had prevailed. an artificial timetable based on political expediency would have led to disaster and could still turn success into defeat. if we had followed senator (candidate last)'s policy, iraq would have descended into chaos, american casualties would be far higher, and the region would be destabilized."<br/></p></span>
