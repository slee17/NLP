<span class="displaytext">i'm happy to be introduced by governor palin, but i can't wait until i introduce her to washington. let me offer an advance warning to the big spending, greedy, do nothing, me first, country second crowd in washington and on wall street: change is coming. <p>we need reform in washington and on wall street. the financial markets are in crisis. times are tough. enormous strain is being put on working families and individuals in america. i know that the events unfolding can be difficult to understand for many americans. the dominos that we have seen fall this week began with the corruption and manipulation of our home loan system. the reason this crisis started was the abuses that took place within our home loan agencies, fannie mae and freddie mac and within our home loan system. </p><p>two years ago i warned this administration and congress that regulations for our home loan agencies, fannie mae and freddie mac, needed to be fixed... </p><p>but nothing was done. </p><p>senator (candidate last) talks a tough game on the financial markets but the facts tell a different story. he took more money from fannie and freddie than any senator but the (PARTY NAME) chairman of the committee that regulates them. he put fannie mae's ceo who helped create this disaster in charge of finding his vice president. fannie's former general counsel is a senior advisor to his campaign. whose side do you think he is on? when i pushed legislation to reform fannie mae and freddie mac, senator (candidate last) was silent. he didn't lift a hand to avert this crisis. while the leaders of fannie and freddie were lining the pockets of his campaign, they were sowing the seeds of the financial crisis we see today and enriching themselves with millions of dollars in payments. that's not change, that's what's broken in washington. </p><p>there was no transparency into the books of wall street banks. banks and brokers took on huge amounts of debt and they hid the riskiest investments. mismanagement and greed became the operating standard while regulators were asleep at the switch. </p><p>the primary regulator of wall street, the securities and exchange commission (sec) kept in place trading rules that let speculators and hedge funds turn our markets into a casino. they allowed naked short selling -- which simply means that you can sell stock without ever owning it. they eliminated last year the uptick rule that has protected investors for 70 years. speculators pounded the shares of even good companies into the ground. </p><p>the chairman of the sec serves at the appointment of the president and has betrayed the public's trust. if i were president today, i would fire him. </p><p>we cannot wait any longer for more failures in our financial system. structures like the resolution trust corporation that dealt with the failed savings and loan industry were designed to clean up the system and worked. today we need a plan that doesn't wait until the system fails. i am calling for the creation of the mortgage and financial institutions trust - the mfi. the priorities of this trust will be to work with the private sector and regulators to identify institutions that are weak and take remedies to strengthen them before they become insolvent. for troubled institutions this will provide an orderly process through which to identify bad loans and eventually sell them. </p><p>this will get the treasury and other financial regulatory authorities in a proactive position instead of reacting in a crisis mode to one situation after the other. the mfi will enhance investor and market confidence, benefit sound financial institutions, assist troubled institutions and protect our financial system, while minimizing taxpayer exposure. tomorrow i will be talking in greater detail about the crisis facing our markets and what i will do as president to fix this crisis and get our economy moving again. </p><p>senator (candidate last) has never made the kind tough reform we need today. his idea of reform is what his party leaders in congress order him to do. we tried for bipartisan ethics reform and he walked away from it because his bosses didn't want real change. i know how to make the change that senator (candidate last) and this congress is afraid of. i've fought both parties to shake up up washington and i'm going to do it as president. </p><p>those same congressional leaders who give senator (candidate last) his marching orders are now saying that this mess isn't their fault and they aren't going to take any action on this crisis until after the election. senator (candidate last)'s own advisers are saying that crisis will benefit him politically. my friends, that is the kind of me-first, country-second politics that are broken in washington. my opponent sees an economic crisis as a political opportunity instead of a time to lead. senator (candidate last) isn't change, he's part of the problem with washington. </p><p>when aig was bailed out, i didn't like it, but i understood it needed to be done to protect hard working americans with insurance policies and annuities. senator (candidate last) didn't take a position. on the biggest issue of the day, he didn't know what to think. he may not realize it, but you don't get to vote present as president of the united states. </p><p>while senator (candidate last) and congressional leaders don't know what to think about the current crisis, we know what their plans are for the economy. today senator (candidate last)'s running mate said that raising taxes is patriotic. raising taxes in a tough economy isn't patriotic. it's not a badge of honor. it's just dumb policy. the billions in tax increases that senator (candidate last) is proposing would kill even more jobs during tough economic times. i'm not going to let that happen. </p><p>i have seen tough times before. i know how to shake-up wall street and washington. i will get this economy moving. i will lead us through this crisis by fighting for you, and when i am president we will be stronger than ever before.</p></span>
