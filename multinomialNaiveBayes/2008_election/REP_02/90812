<span class="displaytext">arlington, va-- u.s. senator (candidate full) today issued the following statement regarding today's united states supreme court ruling on district of columbia v. heller: <p>today's decision is a landmark victory for second amendment freedom in the united states. for this first time in the history of our republic, the u.s. supreme court affirmed that the second amendment right to keep and bear arms was and is an individual right as intended by our founding fathers. i applaud this decision as well as the overturning of the district of columbia's ban on handguns and limitations on the ability to use firearms for self-defense. </p><p>unlike senator (candidate last), who refused to join me in signing a bipartisan amicus brief, i was pleased to express my support and call for the ruling issued today. today's ruling in district of columbia v. heller makes clear that other municipalities like chicago that have banned handguns have infringed on the constitutional rights of americans. unlike the elitist view that believes americans cling to guns out of bitterness, today's ruling recognizes that gun ownership is an important right- sacred, just as the right to free speech and assembly. </p><p>this ruling does not mark the end of our struggle against those who seek to limit the rights of law-abiding citizens. we must always remain vigilant in defense of our freedoms. but today, the supreme court ended forever the specious argument that the second amendment did not confer an individual right to keep and bear arms.</p></span>
