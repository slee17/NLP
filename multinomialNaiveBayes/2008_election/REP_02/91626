(candidate full), cnn (PARTY NAME) presidential candidate debate, manchester, nh, 6/3/07) <b><i> </i></b></p><p>the wall street journal said (candidate full)'s plan to raise the top income tax rates would "stunt small business." "the clear implication is that raising the u.s. personal income tax rates would also stunt small business entrepreneurship. yet this is precisely what all of the (PARTY NAME) presidential candidates, and even mr. rangel, propose." (editorial, "corporate tax war," <i>the wall street journal</i>, 12/4/07) <b> </b></p><p>u.s. department of treasury: small business owners "are frequently subject to the highest individual income tax rates." "changes in the individual income tax affect most businesses in the united states. that is because taxes on business earnings are often paid through the individual income tax when 'passed-through' to business owners. the business income from sole proprietorships, farm proprietorships, partnerships, s corporations, etc., is all taxed at the owners' individual income tax rates. this year 34 million business owners are expected to receive this type of income and pay tax on this income through the individual income tax. these businesses are typically small and often entrepreneurial in nature, and a source of innovation and risk-taking in the economy. moreover, these business owners are frequently subject to the highest individual income tax rates."

"sen. (candidate last) does not support uncapping the full payroll tax of 12.4% rate. instead, he is considering plans that would ask those making over $250,000 to pay in the range of 2% to 4% more in total (combined employer and employee). this change to social security would start a decade or more from now and is similar to the rate increases floated by sen. (candidate last)'s close adviser lindsey graham, and that sen. (candidate last) has previously said he 'could' support." (jason furman and austan goolsbee, op-ed, "the (candidate last) tax plan," <i>the wall street journal</i>, 8/14/08) <b> </b></p><p>(candidate full) would raise capital gains and dividend taxes. "sen. (candidate last)<b>wants to raise the long-term capital-gains rate for families making more than $250,000 to around 20 percent or somewhat higher but not above the 28 percent level it reached during the reagan presidency, an (candidate last) economic adviser says. the same rate would apply to most dividend income for these investors." (tom herman, "tax report your tax bill: how (candidate last), (candidate last)<b>differ," <i>the associated press</i>, 6/18/08) <b> </b></b></b></p><p>(candidate full)'s plan includes required employer coverage similar to the failed (candidate last) mandate of 1993. "(candidate last) would require almost all employers to offer insurance to workers or face a tax penalty, an idea that many businesses abhor and that is also in (candidate last)'s proposal. this employer mandate drove much of the opposition to the (candidate last) plan in 1994." (anne e. kornblut and perry bacon jr., "(candidate last) says washington is ready for health plan," <i>the washington post</i>, 5/30/07) <b> </b></p><p>(candidate full)'s employer mandate will cost $179 billion a year. "in the group market the introduction of play or pay will introduce new employer and consumer costs. in our analysis, we model the financial consequences of play or pay as falling primarily on the consumer. we estimate that the cost of implementing play or pay alone will be $179 billion."

(sara lubbes, "perils and pluses of 'play or pay' insurance mandates," <i>cq healthbeat news</i>, 9/18/07) <b> </b></p><p>the (candidate last) campaign said that it will not detail how much the fine will be for small businesses under his health care plan. "as the presidential candidates push their competing health-care plans, sen. (candidate full) regularly presses sen. (candidate full) to tell voters how big a fine he would impose on companies that don't offer their workers health insurance. ... (candidate last) officials say the campaign has no plans to answer that question before election day on nov. 4. neera tanden, a top (candidate last) policy adviser, said the fine is intended to discourage employers from dropping coverage, not to raise significant revenue."
