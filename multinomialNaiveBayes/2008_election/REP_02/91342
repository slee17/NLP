(candidate last) isn't the only one calling a time-out on new taxes. last week, reps. zoe lofgren (d., calif.) and chris cannon (r., utah) introduced a wireless tax moratorium bill. it's time to protect consumers from this tax collector raid. <b><i></i></b></p><p> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/sb120882237427633083.html?mod=googlenews_wsj"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a><b><i>the editorial in the wall street journal </i></b></p></span>
