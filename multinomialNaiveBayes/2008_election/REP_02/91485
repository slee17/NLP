(candidate last) wanted to thank the troops for their service, but "we learned from the pentagon last night that the visit would be viewed instead as a campaign event.," (candidate last) advisor scott gration, a retired air force major general, said in a statement. </p><p>on (candidate last)'s flight from berlin to paris, gibbs offered more details. around july 15, the pentagon approved (candidate last)'s visit. but military officials later invoked a rule on political activity at military bases and questioned whether it would cover (candidate last)'s visit, gibbs said. </p><p>(candidate last) spokesmen said they were seeking clarification on what the rule is. gibbs also declined to speculate on why the pentagon did not cite the rule until wednesday. </p><p>that account, however, didn't square with the defense department's explanation. the pentagon said it informed the (candidate last) campaign on monday that he and his senate staff could visit landstuhl, where wounded soldiers from iraq and afghanistan are treated, but that no press would be allowed. </p><p>"sen. (candidate last) is more than welcome to visit landstuhl or any other military hospital around the world," said geoff morrell, the pentagon press secretary. "but he has to do so, just as any other senator has to do so, in his official capacity. it is not acceptable to do so as a candidate." </p><p>"in an election year," morrell said, "i don't believe that any candidate is allowed to visit a dod facility with press." </p><p>he cited a pentagon directive that activities "reasonably viewed as directly or indirectly associating the [defense department] with a partisan political activity" should be avoided. </p><p>morrell said the u.s. military was prepared to accommodate (candidate last)'s traveling press and campaign staff at the passenger terminal at ramstein air base, the u.s. air force base in southern germany where (candidate last)'s plane had been cleared to land. </p><p><a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/07/(candidate last)-cancels-x.html"><b><i>read</i></b></a><b><i>the article</i></b></p></span>
