<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- (candidate last)-palin 2008 today released the following statements from former (candidate full) supporters and women for (candidate last) leadership in reaction to (candidate full)'s sexist attack ad "his choice": <p><b><u>virginia</u></b> </p><p><b>judy black, national co-chair, women for (candidate last):</b> "enough is enough! senator (candidate last) has stooped to a new low in his constant attacks on governor palin with his new ad titled, 'his choice.' (candidate full)'s choice has been to attack, demean and ridicule women, first sen. (candidate last) and now gov. palin. american women do not need any more of (candidate last)'s sexist choices or attacks. (candidate full) made the choice to put a strong leader with a proven record forward as his running mate. as a woman, i am outraged by the over-the-top treatment of gov. palin and i urge all women to reject the double standard put forward by a man who was just a state senator in illinois three years ago by voting (candidate last)-palin this tuesday." </p><p><b>patty denton, washington county (PARTY NAME) chairwoman:</b> "we, as a country, should be past the days in which women were treated as inferior. women are the backbone of this country. it's disappointing for senator (candidate last), who has proclaimed change' as his mantra, to disregard the monumental progress women have made in this country. governor palin is an exceptional leader and has fought on the side of all americans, regardless of race or gender. these types of ads show that the (candidate last) campaign is willing to do anything to score a few political cheap shots at the expense of women. on november 4th, women will go to the polls and demand respect for themselves and their daughters from the type of negative attacks perpetrated by senator (candidate last)." </p><p><b><u>missouri</u></b> </p><p><b>representative jo ann emerson:</b> "with more executive experience than (candidate full) and (candidate full) combined, governor sarah palin holds her own on the national scene and embodies the values that americans want in those who will lead our country. this ad is just one more example of the constant attacks from the (candidate last)-(candidate last) campaign. with each attack, they attempt to dismiss the intelligent, qualified, and experienced woman who will soon become our next vice-president of the united states." </p><p><b>sharon barnes, missouri state chair women for (candidate last):</b> "these attacks on governor sarah palin show the desperation of the (PARTY NAME) party to try to stem the overwhelming support for the maverick (PARTY NAME) team of (candidate full) and governor sarah palin - a team dedicated to bringing about the right kind of change for the people of this country. the voters of this great nation will not be fooled. gov. palin is a proven leader and serious reformer with experience in economics, defense and foreign policy that the (PARTY NAME) candidate for president can only wish he had." </p><p><b><u>california</u></b> </p><p><b>shelly mandell, president of los angeles chapter of the national organization for women:</b> "i am outraged by the new ad put out by (candidate full). it is sexist and demeaning to women. these tactics started with (candidate full) and continue, growing even more disgusting with gov. palin. i was a hillstar for hillary and an avid supporter. trashing two women clearly in a sexist manner in one election is an outrage and must be identified and stopped. there must be consequences. let female (candidate last) supporters take a good look at this and still believe their candidate supports women's rights and women's dignity." </p><p><b>prameela bartholomeusz, dnc platform committee member:</b> "i am once again stunned at the personal and sexist attacks by the (candidate last) campaign against gov. palin. this latest ad is sexist and offensive. the gov. of alaska has been managing and balancing a budget of $10 billion; i think she knows a bit about economics. sen. (candidate last) never spoke up against sexism during the primary season, and is not speaking out against misogyny during this phase of the election season -- he is contributing to it. i have no confidence that sen. (candidate last) will fight for women's issues if elected. this sets women back decades." </p><p><b><u>pennsylvania</u></b> </p><p><b>christine j. toretti, pa women for (candidate last) co-chair, pa national committeewoman:</b> "vice presidential running mate, sarah palin, is an experienced public servant. as governor of alaska and as mayor of wasilla she proved to be an effective leader and businesswoman. senator (candidate last)'s baseless attack on governor palin is preposterous. god forbid a leader is not only competent, but beautiful and wears a skirt!" </p><p><b>bernie comfort, pennsylvania women for (candidate last) state chair:</b> "senator (candidate last)'s ad simply mocks governor palin. the real truth is gov. palin has experience dealing with the economy as an executive running the state of alaska and as a business owner. she is the experienced leader we need to lead this country with (candidate full)." </p><p><b>stephanie bressler, ph.d, (candidate full) supporter, university of scranton women and politics professor:</b> "it's a sexist example of reducing a woman to an object - a wink - and denying her a voice. her lips are actually moving, but she's not allowed to be heard." </p><p><b><u>ohio</u></b> </p><p><b>barbara rosier-tryon, member of the warren (PARTY NAME) women's club:</b> "this is yet another sexist cheap shot on gov. palin's image from the (candidate last)-(candidate last) campaign. sarah palin's record of reform and experience as governor of alaska and commander of the state's national guard is more distinguished than (candidate full)'s one and only term in the u.s. senate." </p><p><b><u>north carolina</u></b> </p><p><b>martha jenkins, north carolina women for (candidate last) state chairman:</b> "(candidate full) chose (candidate full) to make up for his own lack of foreign policy expertise. he has absolutely no reason to criticize (candidate last)'s pick of palin. gov. palin is infinitely more qualified than (candidate full). in running this ad, (candidate last) is acknowledging that gov. palin is an effective and a positive part of (candidate full)'s candidacy; otherwise, why focus on her at all? (candidate full) is using this ad to divert attention from the fact that the american public is realizing that (candidate last) is just as radical as his associates, and that he lacks the experience and judgment to be president of the united states." </p><p><b><u>florida</u></b> </p><p><b>albert chang, regional director of citizens for (candidate last), a group that includes (PARTY NAME) and independents:</b> "we look forward to winning tampa and the surrounding counties for (candidate last)-palin. this ad is a distracting personal attack on an experienced executive and the voters of florida will see through it. this campaign will remain focused on issues impacting the everyday lives of floridians and americans." </p><p><b>mary calderon, tampa, former senator (candidate last) supporter:</b> "i'm disappointed that senator (candidate last) has resorted to personal attacks at this point in the campaign. would any male candidate for vice president of the united states be afforded similar treatment by the (candidate last) campaign? i would say not." </p><p><b><u>indiana</u></b> </p><p><b>judy singleton, indiana women for (candidate last) co-chair:</b> "(candidate last) seems to have a problem with strong, smart women. ask hillary. running an ad like this is an affront to talented women everywhere. to imply that gov. palin doesn't understand economics because she's pretty and winks is ridiculous. as a governor, she's proved she understands the economy better than (candidate full), who hasn't completed his first term in the senate, does. all one has to do is look at her record of leadership on economic development and then look at his." </p><p><b><u>new york</u></b> </p><p><b>amy siskind, ambassador for hillary:</b> "when senator (candidate full) was demeaned and degraded during the presidential primary, many of us of, myself included, vowed 'never again'. the treatment of governor palin by both the main stream media, and now the (candidate last) campaign, shows that the misogyny fest is alive and well in our country. there has been a complete and utter smear job of our fellow citizen, sarah palin, who is only trying to serve her country."</p></span>
