(candidate full). </p><p>from his stint in the illinois senate to his even shorter time in the u.s. senate, (candidate full) has made it a habit to avoid the politically risky move. whether it was funding our military fighting for freedom, or avoiding the call for regulation of fannie mae and freddie mac, when (candidate full) and i sounded the alarm, there have been two guiding principals of sen. (candidate last)'s career: political expediency and blind ambition. </p><p>at this moment in our history, it is imperative we choose someone who can lead in a bipartisan manner. (candidate full)'s career in the senate is a testament to this type of leadership. </p><p>he was willing to put good policy ahead of his presidential campaign by joining with liberal icon sen. ted kennedy on immigration reform. </p><p>he partnered with sen. joe lieberman to bring the first real climate change bill to a vote in the senate and he teamed with sen. russ feingold, d-wis., to usher in campaign finance reform. </p><p>ironically, (candidate last) rejected the (candidate last)-feingold law this election, making him the first person to use unlimited money -- a large portion unreported to this day -- since the days of watergate. </p><p><b><i><a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/opinion/sfl-forum31melsboct31,0,106089.story">read</a> the entire article</i></b></p></span>
