(candidate last) and giving control of the presidency and congress to the same party. </p><p>but in this time of great anxiety, the american people need a leader of experience guiding the ship of state. mr. (candidate last) offers the continuity, stability and sense of authority people want, as well as a decisive break from the bush years. </p><p>the (PARTY NAME) talks about change, but only the (PARTY NAME) has made change happen. only one candidate has a solid record of standing up to his own party on principle and working hand in hand with legislators from the opposing party to get things done. </p><p>that candidate is (candidate full), a progressive conservative we recommend. </p><p>the experience gap </p><p>it's easy to see why the admirable (candidate full) has won so many hearts this year. he's as smooth and charismatic as his opponent is raw and irascible. but voters aren't electing a debater-in-chief. they should keep their heads and their eyes focused on the record. </p><p>mr. (candidate last) has shown the bipartisan leadership americans want. for example, the (PARTY NAME) maverick has worked with (PARTY NAME) on campaign finance laws, immigration reform and climate change. when party infighting brought the senate to a standstill on judicial nominations, mr. (candidate last) led the way to an audacious compromise that broke the logjam. </p><p>moreover, mr. (candidate last) has often opposed his own party when he believed it was the right thing to do. for example, though he supported the iraq war, mr. (candidate last) emerged early as a critic of the bush strategy at a time when the safe (PARTY NAME) move was go along to get along. his leadership was arguably a key factor in forcing the bush administration to change its ways, adapting a strategy that finally worked. </p><p>the arizona senator's change agenda didn't always bear fruit but he fought nobly even in defeat. for example, mr. (candidate last) believed so strongly in comprehensive immigration reform that he nearly destroyed his presidential campaign to fight for it. </p><p>that takes guts the kind america will need from its leader in the difficult days ahead. </p><p>deficit hawk </p><p>how difficult? beyond the immediate credit crisis looms a monumentally larger threat, a $53 trillion entitlement-spending catastrophe that threatens to sink the nation under a sea of red ink. mr. (candidate last) has a solid record of trying to control washington's spending habits. this issue, more than any other, is why americans should put mr. (candidate last) in the white house. </p><p>he clearly has set himself apart from mr. (candidate last) on federal spending. mr. (candidate last) is the one who promised to freeze domestic spending his first year and then limit it to 2.4 percent growth the rest of his term. he also has been clear about the urgent need for entitlement reform. </p><p>you don't see that kind of independence with mr. (candidate last), who has marched in spending lockstep with his party and mostly ducked questions about entitlement reform and budget cuts. </p><p>the last time the nation saw washington make real progress on deficit reduction was the 1990s, when a (PARTY NAME) controlled the white house and (PARTY NAME)s held congress. true, (PARTY NAME)s failed to cover themselves in deficit-reduction glory when they held the executive and legislative branches, but we read that as an argument in favor of divided government. </p><p>progressive conservatism </p><p>as inspiring as mr. (candidate last)'s history-making presidential bid has been, it is risky to take a chance on an untried leader at this point in our history. </p><p>to be sure, a (candidate last) vote also involves an element of risk. his bellicose temperament causes concern, chiefly about his impulsive judgment. if this election were about congeniality and cool, mr. (candidate last) would easily prevail. </p><p>but electing the president is not a popularity contest. mr. (candidate last) has better policies. he has more experience. and he has proven independence of mind. </p><p>in these tough times, (candidate full) is the right man for america. </p><p><a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/editorials/stories/dn-nutwospots_19edi.state.edition1.2908f55.html"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the editorial</p></span>
