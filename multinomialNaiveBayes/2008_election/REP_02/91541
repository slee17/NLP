<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today the (candidate last)-palin campaign announced the endorsement of maria conchita alonso, a latin american actress who has starred in television and film for three decades. alonso, who was born in cuba and raised in venezuela, recently appeared on <i>csi: miami </i>and <i>desperate housewives </i>and<i>starred alongside arnold schwarzenegger in <i>the running man</i>. </i><p>"as a latina and a new american citizen, i believe in this country and its people, and i believe that we need more than just 'change.' we need a leader who can bring about the right kind of change, and (candidate full) has the experience and judgment necessary to lead us in these uncertain times," alonso said. "i grew up in cuba and venezuela, and i am appalled that (candidate full) apparently wants to emulate the "spread the wealth" economic policies of those countries and negotiate with their leaders. for me the choice is clear, and i believe it is my duty to share my views even though it might not make me popular in hollywood." </p><p>after a successful career in venezuela as a beauty queen, telenovela star, film actress and singer, alonso emigrated to the united states from caracas, venezuela in 1982. she has appeared in dozens of films and television shows since then and was the first south american star to star on broadway.</p></span>
