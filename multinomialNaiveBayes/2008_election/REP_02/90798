<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full) today issued the following statement on the third anniversary of the cedar revolution: <p>"it has been over three years since former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri was assassinated in the streets of beirut. following his murder, the lebanese people came together in the cedar revolution,' which saw its culmination on march 14, 2005. this popular movement led to the demise of lebanon's syrian occupiers, iranian proxies in their midst, and the puppet government that denied them independence and freedom. </p><p>"sadly, three years later, so much of this promise remains unrealized as the forces of repression stand firm against the prospect of a free lebanon. syria and iran have reasserted their dominance and paralyzed lebanon's government, which earlier this week postponed election of a new president for the 16th time. those who are systematically killing lebanese patriots and denying the lebanese people their democracy must be brought to justice. i commend lebanese of all religions and sects who reject syrian and iranian terror and tyranny and embrace the great principles of the cedar revolution."</p></span>
