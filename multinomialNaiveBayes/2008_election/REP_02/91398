(candidate full) once said that proponents of off shore drilling want to quote rape the outer continental shelf.' why do we need to drill more and what other policies would you support towards energy independence? </p><p><b>palin:</b> american people are a lot smarter than what (candidate last) is giving them credit for there. we are understanding that we are on an unsustainable path and we are relying on countries that don't like us very much to provide fuel for our economy and for our cars and our trucks; and oil to heat our homes and places of business and our schools. (candidate full) and i know that we need a comprehensive, all-of-the-above approach and that does mean drilling domestic supplies of energy, keeping options on the table that can include that offshore drilling that's safe and sound, and also alternative sources of energy and also stepping up greater conservation efforts here in america also. and as governor i've pushed for and championed the largest infrastructure project in north america's history, that's alaska natural gas pipeline, that's underway. we need to maximize recovery of domestic resources; we can minimize waste as we do this. and we are going to help lead to less dependence on foreign supplies. and it is scary that senator (candidate last) has not grasped that yet. he has had ample opportunity to support domestic solutions here and every time he gets the opportunity he votes no' on all options. </p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj8dotavaa8"><b><i>listen</i></b></a><b><i>to governor palin</i></b></p></span>
