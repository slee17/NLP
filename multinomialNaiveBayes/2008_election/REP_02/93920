<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, u.s. senator (candidate full) issued the following statement on the u.s.-india civilian nuclear agreement and the decision by the nuclear suppliers group (nsg): <p>"i welcome today's decision by the 45 nation nuclear suppliers group to lift the global ban on civilian nuclear trade with india. this step, which is critical to implementing the u.s.-india civilian nuclear agreement, represents another building block in the partnership between our two countries. </p><p>"because the agreement will further involve india in the global nonproliferation regime, strengthen the ongoing transformation of u.s.-india relations, and reduce india's dependence on carbon-emitting energy sources, i supported it early on and without equivocation. the same cannot be said of my opponent, who supported 'poison pill' amendments on the senate floor that would have had the effect of killing this important agreement. now that the nsg has approved it, congressional leaders should act expeditiously to pass the u.s.-india nuclear agreement here at home."</p></span>
