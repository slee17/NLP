(candidate full)'s position of meeting unconditionally with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and leaders of other american enemies. </p><p>sen. joseph r. (candidate last) jr. of delaware, former sen. gary hart of colorado and former rep. harold e. ford jr. of tennessee distanced themselves from mr. (candidate last)'s position, each saying that preconditions for any such meeting would be essential. </p><p>"i'll concede, you cannot meet with foreign leaders -- with terrorists, rather, those that lead rogue nations -- without some conditions," mr. ford said on nbc's "meet the press." </p><p>mr. (candidate last) was asked in a (PARTY NAME) debate in july whether he would "be willing to meet separately, without precondition ... with the leaders of iran, syria, venezuela, cuba and north korea." </p><p>"i would," mr. (candidate last) said. "and the reason is this: that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them -- which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration -- is ridiculous. ... we have the obligation to find areas where we can potentially move forward. i think that it is a disgrace that we have not spoken to them." </p><p>mr. (candidate last) later said he would first send lower-level diplomats to prepare high-level talks, but has continued to pledge to hold such unconditional meetings. mr. hart yesterday pointed to that distinction in the (PARTY NAME) presidential candidate's position. </p><p>"i don't think (candidate full) or any other president is going to meet with a head of state without lower-level discussions preceding that," he said on cnn's "late edition." "what you do is send diplomats and negotiators to explore areas of mutual interest. and if it does seem profitable, then you go to the heads of state." </p><p>mr. (candidate last), who is chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and sought the (PARTY NAME) presidential nod this year, said mr. (candidate last) gave the "wrong answer" in the debate, but added that the senator from illinois has "learned a hell of a lot." </p><p>"what we're talking about here is that he has repeatedly since then said he would not negotiate unconditionally, meaning him sitting down, alone, right off the bat with these leaders," mr. (candidate last) said on abc's "this week." </p><p>"this is a fellow who i think shorthanded an answer that in fact was the wrong answer, in my view, saying i would within my first year, it implied he'd personally sit down with anybody who wanted to sit down with him. that's not what he meant. that's not what he has said since then for the last year or thereabout." </p><p>mr. (candidate last) said in february that he has been misunderstood. "i will meet without preconditions," he said on cnn's "the situation room." </p><p>his campaign web site includes a line under the heading "diplomacy": "(candidate full) is the only major candidate who supports tough, direct presidential diplomacy with iran without preconditions." </p><p>the issue resurfaced last week when president bush, delivering a speech to israel's knesset in jerusalem, spoke of iran, and then said: "some seem to believe that we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals, as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along. ... we have an obligation to call this what it is: the false comfort of appeasement, which has been repeatedly discredited by history." </p><p>mr. (candidate last) took umbrage, but the white house said the president's remarks were aimed at all who advocate appeasement. </p><p>white house spokeswoman dana perino jabbed at the (PARTY NAME) front-runner, saying: "i understand when you're running for office you sometimes think the world revolves around you." </p><p>one white house official later said the remark was aimed partially at former president jimmy carter, who recently held talks with hamas leaders. </p><p>presumptive (PARTY NAME) candidate sen. (candidate full) of arizona got involved thursday, asking, "why does ... senator (candidate last) want to sit down with a state sponsor of terrorism?" he said mr. (candidate last)'s stance shows "naivete and inexperience and lack of judgment." </p><p>the line has become the subject of political commentary. yesterday, the (candidate last) campaign responded by repeating the candidate's stance of meeting without preconditions and saying mr. (candidate last) practices "bush-style bluster." </p><p>"while (candidate full) wants to continue the bush diplomacy of talking tough in washington and hoping for the best, (candidate full) has been clear and consistent in calling for tough and principled diplomacy without preconditions," (candidate last) campaign spokesman bill burton said. </p><p>meanwhile yesterday, mr. (candidate last) campaigned in oregon while his (PARTY NAME) rival, sen. hillary rodham (candidate last) of new york, hit the trail in kentucky. both states hold their primaries tomorrow. mr. (candidate last) is favored to win oregon, while mrs. (candidate last) appears to be well ahead in kentucky. </p><p>mr. (candidate last) did not campaign yesterday. instead, he raised money in new york over the weekend and appeared on "saturday night live." </p><p>"good evening, my fellow americans," mr. (candidate last) said in a mock political ad. "i ask you: what should we be looking for in our next president? certainly, someone who is very, very, very old." </p><p>closing his appeal, he said: "i have the courage, the wisdom, the experience and, most importantly, the oldness necessary." </p><p><a href="http://washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20080519/nation/410224736/1001&amp;template=printart"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the washington times article <b><i></i></b></p><p>also <a href="http://www.nysun.com/news/national/(PARTY NAME)s-sense-opening-divide-over-(candidate last)-pledge"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the new york sun article <b><u> </u></b></p><p>check out these youtubes:  </p><ul> <li> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3oj7jn9rv4/ohttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3oj7jn9rv4"><b><i><u> watch</u></i></b> </a><b><i>sen.
