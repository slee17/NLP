<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full) today issued the following statement on (candidate full)'s recent comments regarding nafta: <p>"for months, (candidate full) said that he would 'make sure that we renegotiate' nafta, demanded unilateral changes and threatened to unilaterally withdraw if he did not get his way. (candidate full) knew better. america has not had a protectionist president since herbert hoover, but (candidate full) held his position anyway to further his cynical political purposes in the primary campaign. now he claims: 'i'm not a big believer in doing things unilaterally.' (candidate full) should know words matter -- especially in a campaign based on rhetoric rather than a record of accomplishment. the american people and our allies deserve better than calculated efforts to re-invent positions to sound less irresponsible."</p></span>
