<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full) today issued the following statement on malaria awareness day: <p>"malaria kills more than a million people a year in africa -- and a child every thirty seconds. yet it is well within our grasp to defeat this disease. if elected president, i will pledge to end malaria in africa. </p><p>"the united states has honored its proud history of global service by being a leader in the fight against malaria. at present, the federal government is on track to commit $1 billion each year. but america is more than its government. i call upon the private sector to meet its obligation to serve a cause greater than its self-interest by matching the federal commitment dollar for dollar. meeting this goal will achieve a level of funding that will rapidly roll back the dreadful impact of malaria on the global community."</p></span>
