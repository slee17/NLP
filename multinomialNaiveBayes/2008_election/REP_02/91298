(candidate last) is much newer to most voters, less familiar and more dependent on the impressions he is only now creating. </p><p>that is why a pair of strategy decisions made in the past two weeks could prove troublesome for him. the first was (candidate last)'s turning down (candidate last)'s invitation to join him in a series of town hall meetings where they would appear together and answer questions from real voters -- without a formal agenda, press panel or professional interviewers. </p><p>(candidate last)'s manager initially called the idea "appealing," but nine days later, when david plouffe got around to responding, he countered with something quite different from the 10 informal discussions (candidate last) proposed holding before the late-summer nominating conventions. plouffe said that in addition to the three traditional debates under official sponsorship later in the fall, there could be only two others -- one on economics on july 4 and another on foreign policy in august. </p><p>the (candidate last) side said that few americans would sacrifice their independence day holiday to watch a debate and reiterated its offer to meet (candidate last) anywhere he wanted on any of the next 10 thursdays. </p><p>at a news briefing last week, (candidate last) spokesman robert gibbs characterized that as a "take it or leave it" stance by the (PARTY NAME)s and suggested that discussions were finished. </p><p>at the same briefing, gibbs and campaign counsel bob bauer defended (candidate last)'s decision to become the first presidential candidate since the watergate reforms to decline public financing of his general election campaign. </p><p>gibbs and bauer in effect blamed (candidate last), saying repeatedly that he was "gaming the system" by pledging to accept public funds while saying he could not "referee" spending by outside independent groups if it occurred. in fact, (candidate last) had been far more vocal in denouncing such groups on the gop side than (candidate last) was in criticizing their counterparts playing (PARTY NAME) presidential politics -- even though (candidate last) has claimed the mantle of campaign finance reformer that (candidate last) has long enjoyed. </p><p>but it's also the case that the multiple joint town meetings (candidate last) proposed would be a real service to the public and that suspending the dollar chase for the duration of the campaign, as (candidate last) but not (candidate last) will do, would be a major step toward establishing the credibility of the election process. </p><p>by refusing to join (candidate last) in these initiatives in order to protect his own interests, (candidate last) raises an important question: has he built sufficient trust so that his motives will be accepted by the voters who are only now starting to figure out what makes him tick? <b><i></i></b></p><p> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/20/ar2008062002275_pf.html"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a><b><i>the full article in washington post </i></b></p></span>
