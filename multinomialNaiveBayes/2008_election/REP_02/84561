<span class="displaytext">it's great to be here in miami. florida is a must-win state on november 4th, and with your help, we're going to win florida, and bring change to washington, dc. <p>we had a good debate this week. you may have noticed -- there was a lot of talk about senator (candidate last)'s tax increases and joe the plumber. last weekend, senator (candidate last) showed up in joe's driveway to ask for his vote, and joe asked senator (candidate last) a tough question. i'm glad he did; i think senator (candidate last) could use a few more tough questions. </p><p>the response from senator (candidate last) and his campaign yesterday was to attack joe. people are digging through his personal life and he has tv crews camped out in front of his house. he didn't ask for senator (candidate last) to come to his house. he wasn't recruited or prompted by our campaign. he just asked a question. and americans ought to be able to ask senator (candidate last) tough questions without being smeared and targeted with political attacks. </p><p>the question joe asked about our economy is important, because senator (candidate last)'s plan would raise taxes on small businesses that employ 16 million americans. senator (candidate last)'s plan will kill those jobs at just the time when we need to be creating more jobs. my plan will create jobs, and that's what america needs. </p><p>senator (candidate last) says that he wanted to spread your wealth around. when politicians talk about taking your money and spreading it around, you'd better hold onto your wallet. senator (candidate last) claims that wants to give a tax break to the middle class, but not only did he vote for higher taxes on the middle class in the senate, his plan gives away your tax dollars to those who don't pay taxes. that's not a tax cut, that's welfare. america didn't become the greatest nation on earth by redistributing wealth; we became the greatest nation by creating new wealth. </p><p>this is the choice that we face. these are hard times. our economy is in crisis. americans are fighting in two wars. we face many enemies in this dangerous world, and many challenges here at home. </p><p>the next president won't have time to get used to the office. he won't have the luxury of studying up on the issues before he acts. he will have to act immediately. and to do that, he will need experience, courage, judgment and a bold plan of action to take this country in a new direction. we cannot spend the next four years as we have spent much of the last eight: waiting for our luck to change. we have to act immediately. i said it at the last debate: i'm not george bush; if senator (candidate last) wants to run against george bush, he should have run for president 4 years ago. we need a new direction now. we have to fight for it. </p><p>i've been fighting for this country since i was seventeen years old, and i have the scars to prove it. if i'm elected president, i will fight to take america in a new direction from my first day in office until my last. i'm not afraid of the fight, i'm ready for it. </p><p>i'm not going to spend $700 billion dollars of your money just bailing out the wall street bankers and brokers who got us into this mess. i'm going to make sure we take care of the people who were devastated by the excesses of wall street and washington. i'm going to spend a lot of that money to bring relief to you, and i'm not going to wait sixty days to start doing it. </p><p>i have a plan to protect the value of your home and get it rising again by buying up bad mortgages and refinancing them so if your neighbor defaults he doesn't bring down the value of your house with him. </p><p>i have a plan to let retirees and people nearing retirement keep their money in their retirement accounts longer so they can rebuild their savings. </p><p>i will protect social security so that retirees get the benefits they have earned, and i will bring both parties together to fix social security so that it is there for future generations. </p><p>i have a plan to hold the line on taxes and cut them to make america more competitive and create jobs here at home. </p><p>raising taxes makes a bad economy much worse. keeping taxes low creates jobs, keeps money in your hands and strengthens our economy. </p><p>the explosion of government spending over the last eight years has put us deeper in debt to foreign countries that don't have our best interests at heart. it weakened the dollar and made everything you buy more expensive. </p><p>if i'm elected president, i won't spend nearly a trillion dollars more of your money, on top of the $700 billion we just gave the treasury secretary, as senator (candidate last) proposes. because he can't do that without raising your taxes or digging us further into debt. i'm going to make government live on a budget just like you do. </p><p>i will freeze government spending on all but the most important programs like defense, veterans care, social security and health care until we scrub every single government program and get rid of the ones that aren't working for the american people. and i will veto every single pork barrel bill congresses passes. </p><p>if i'm elected president, i won't fine small businesses and families with children, as senator (candidate last) proposes, to force them into a new huge government run health care program, while he keeps the cost of the fine a secret until he hits you with it. i will bring down the skyrocketing cost of health care with competition and choice to lower your premiums, and make it more available to more americans. i'll make sure you can keep the same health plan if you change jobs or leave a job to stay home. </p><p>i will provide every single american family with a $5000 refundable tax credit to help them purchase insurance. workers who already have health care insurance from their employers will keep it and have more money to cover costs. workers who don't have health insurance can use it to find a policy anywhere in this country to meet their basic needs. </p><p>if i'm elected president, i won't raise taxes on small businesses, as senator (candidate last) proposes, and force them to cut jobs. i will keep small business taxes where they are, help them keep their costs low, and let them spend their earnings to create more jobs. </p><p>if i'm elected president, i won't meet unconditionally with the castro brothers, while they keep political prisoners in jail, stifle free media and block free elections in cuba. when i am president, we are going to pressure the cuban government to free their people. the day is coming when cuba will be free. </p><p>i will open new markets to goods made in america and make sure our trade is free and fair. and i'll make sure we help workers who've lost a job that won't come back find a new one that won't go away. </p><p>if i'm elected president, i won't make it harder to sell our goods overseas and kill more jobs as senator (candidate last) proposes. i will open new markets to goods made in america and make sure our trade is free and fair. and i'll make sure we help workers who've lost a job that won't come back find a new one that won't go away. </p><p>the last president to raise taxes and restrict trade in a bad economy as senator (candidate last) proposes was herbert hoover. that turned a recession into a depression. they say those who don't learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them. well, my friends, i know my history lessons, and i sure won't make the mistakes senator (candidate last) will. </p><p>if i'm elected president, we're going to stop sending $700 billion to countries that don't like us very much. i won't argue to delay drilling for more oil and gas and building new nuclear power plants in america, as senator (candidate last) does. we will start new drilling now. we will invest in all energy alternatives -- nuclear, wind, solar, and tide. we will encourage the manufacture of hybrid, flex fuel and electric automobiles. we will invest in clean coal technology. we will lower the cost of energy within months, and we will create millions of new jobs. </p><p>let me give you the state of the race today. we have 18 days to go. we're 6 points down. the national media has written us off. senator (candidate last) is measuring the drapes, and planning with speaker pelosi and senator reid to raise taxes, increase spending, take away your right to vote by secret ballot in labor elections, and concede defeat in iraq. but they forgot to let you decide. my friends, we've got them just where we want them. </p><p>what america needs in this hour is a fighter; someone who puts all his cards on the table and trusts the judgment of the american people. i come from a long line of (candidate last)s who believed that to love america is to fight for her. i have fought for you most of my life. there are other ways to love this country, but i've never been the kind to do it from the sidelines. </p><p>i know you're worried. america is a great country, but we are at a moment of national crisis that will determine our future. will we continue to lead the world's economies or will we be overtaken? will the world become safer or more dangerous? will our military remain the strongest in the world? will our children and grandchildren's future be brighter than ours? </p><p>my answer to you is yes. yes, we will lead. yes, we will prosper. yes, we will be safer. yes, we will pass on to our children a stronger, better country. but we must be prepared to act swiftly, boldly, with courage and wisdom. </p><p>i know what fear feels like. it's a thief in the night who robs your strength. </p><p>i know what hopelessness feels like. it's an enemy who defeats your will. </p><p>i felt those things once before. i will never let them in again. i'm an american. and i choose to fight. </p><p>don't give up hope. be strong. have courage. and fight. </p><p>fight for a new direction for our country. fight for what's right for america. </p><p>fight to clean up the mess of corruption, infighting and selfishness in washington. </p><p>fight to get our economy out of the ditch and back in the lead. </p><p>fight for the ideals and character of a free people. </p><p>fight for our children's future. </p><p>fight for justice and opportunity for all. </p><p>stand up to defend our country from its enemies. </p><p>stand up, stand up, stand up and fight. america is worth fighting for. nothing is inevitable here. we never give up. we never quit. we never hide from history. we make history. </p><p>now, let's go win this election and get this country moving again.</p></span>
