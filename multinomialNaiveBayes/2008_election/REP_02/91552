<span class="displaytext"><b>arlington, va -- </b>today, (candidate last) spokesman tucker bounds issued the following statement concerning (candidate full)'s role in the senate's terrorist surveillance debate: <p><i>"a few short months ago, (candidate full) outwardly opposed terrorist surveillance legislation, saying that he would filibuster any bill that includes immunity for american telecommunications companies that had been asked by the government to participate in the program. today, the u.s. senate will approve legislation providing the immunity (candidate full) supposedly opposed, and despite his promise, he will not support a filibuster. what (candidate full) will do is show that he's willing to change positions, break campaign commitments and undermine his own words in his quest for higher office." </i> </p><p><b><u>during the primaries, (candidate full) pledged to filibuster any bill which contained immunity for telecommunications companies involved in electronic surveillance, but now backs a bill that would do just that</u></b> </p><p><b>in october 2007, the (candidate last) campaign pledged he would filibuster "any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies."</b> (candidate last) spokesman bill burton: "to be clear: barack will support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies."
