(candidate full) goes back with this organization. it's a community organizing organization. he was a community organizer. they crossed paths back in chicago, worked together, he trained some of them. as an attorney, he represented the acorn group in a motor voter case in the state of illinois. a case that he won. and in the primary campaign, (candidate full)'s campaign gave $800,000 to a subsidiary of acorn to go out and register to vote. now, today i'm told that the (candidate last) campaign is saying that we may have paid them some money for canvassing, but in earlier e-mails with the (candidate last) campaign, they did say that they paid them $800,000, a subsidiary of acorn in the primary to garner votes. but the (candidate last) campaign is trying to say now is, look, we are not working with them in the general election. that was the primary, this is the general election and these problems that we're seeing su rfacing right now are in the general election therefore we're not connected with acorn." <b></b></p><p>blitzer: "but drew, are they confirming that they weren't with what you are describing as a subsidiary of acorn or some third party that in turn went ahead and subcontracted to acorn?" <b></b></p><p>griffin: "no, in earlier e-mails with the (candidate last) campaign, our producer kathleen johnson specifically spelled that out with their people, ben labolt in chicago who said, look, yeah we did work with them, a subsidiary of acorn back in the primary, but we are not working with them anymore. i also want to point out, you know we were talking about whether or not this is a nonpartisan group or not. i attended a volunteer rally with acorn. i would say 50% of the people had on acorn for (candidate last) t-shirts. so to say that this group is non-partisan or not somehow connected or at least favorable towards the (candidate last) campaign i don't think is accurate." </p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akhchjmnz-y"><b><i><u> watch</u></i></b> </a> the cnn report</p></span>
