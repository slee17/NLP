<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full)'s presidential campaign today released a new television ad entitled "pump." the ad highlights (candidate full)'s opposition to initiatives that will help to lower gas prices and achieve energy independence. (candidate full) opposes more drilling in america, expanding nuclear energy use and incentives to spark electric-car research. unlike (candidate full), (candidate full) has proposed a comprehensive, balanced plan to achieve energy independence -- the lexington project -- that supports more drilling, expands the use of nuclear energy, encouraging more research while investing in alternative energy sources. the ad will air on national cable and in key states. <p><b>view the ad here:</b> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eitps4mk3d8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eitps4mk3d8</a> </p><p><b><u>script for "pump" (tv :30)</u></b> </p><p><b>anncr: </b><i>gas prices - $4, $5, no end in sight, because some in washington are still saying no to drilling in america.</i> </p><p><i>no to independence from foreign oil.</i> </p><p><i>who can you thank for rising prices at the pump?</i> </p><p><b>chant:</b> <i>(candidate last), (candidate last)</i> </p><p><b>anncr:</b> <i>one man knows we must now drill more in america and rescue our family budgets.</i> </p><p><i>don't hope for more energy, vote for it.

(candidate last) derides this as a gimmick, but (candidate last)'s idea for developing a radically better battery for powering a new generation of cars strikes us as smarter than more bureaucratic approaches. like the x-prize that helped propel the first civilian aircraft into space, a reward can leverage huge private investment. the idea would be better, though, if it focused on building radically more fuel-efficient cars regardless of the technology."
