<b><u> </u></b></p><p>the honorable robert "bud" mcfarlane:  </p><p>bud mcfarlane: "it was truly surprising to me. senator (candidate last) someday may have the good fortune to be able to engage with foreign leaders or to have become as well read as (candidate full) in history and in national security affairs, but it doesn't exist right now and for general clark to portray (candidate full) as somehow unqualified is truly an unworthy comment that is astonishing to me. we couldn't find truly today in contemporary political leadership of our country a better qualified person to lead us in international affairs in solving the rather daunting agenda problems we have to face in the years ahead." <b><u> </u></b></p><p>col. bud day, usaf (ret.), medal of honor:<i><b></b></i></p><p>bud day: "going downtown to hanoi was absolutely the most dangerous enterprise anyone could be involved in, in 1967. it was the most heavily defended city in the world and no one who had been downtown, no one who had been in a vietnamese prison, no one who fought combat in vietnam will ever question (candidate full)'s warrior credentials. this backhanded slap against john of not being a worthy warrior because he just got shot down is one of the more surprising insults in my military history." <b><u> </u></b></p><p>lt. commander carl smith, usnr (ret.)  </p><p>carl smith: "i've known (candidate full) since 1975. i had the privilege of serving with him in va 174. i was there the entire time when he was the xo and co, and i too am shocked and disappointed to see someone of general clark's stature demean (candidate full)'s service and his performance at that squadron. the truth is his performance was nothing less than extraordinary. he took a squadron that was just pretty much flat lining and mediocre and turned it into an extraordinary success. and he did it through his leadership and it's as simple as that." </p><p>... </p><p>"i find general clark's comments to be unworthy, unseemly, for someone of his stature. and for a campaign that prides itself on the good judgment of its candidate, i think this reflects extremely bad judgment on the entire organization." <b><u> </u></b></p><p>the honorable orson swindle, lt. col. usmc (ret.):  </p><p>orson swindle: "senator (candidate last) is a good person. no doubt about that. he's inexperienced. lacks good judgment, in my opinion. but, you know, he's the one that said he was setting high standards. he was running a civil campaign. i would assume that that means those under him would do similarly. you know, what do we want him to do? number one, he could probably apologize to (candidate full) for the unsavory and inaccurate and terrible words of general mcpeak and general wes clark. those of us on the phone here with you today have god only knows how many decades of experience serving this country. and our service has been characterized by courage, by character, by integrity, by a sense of honor and duty and honesty. we live by that creed, those codes, those characteristics. (candidate full) is of that mindset. that's what we have done in our careers. what do we expect? we expect courage, character, integrity, honor, loyalty. and we're not seeing it f rom this civil campaign. as several others have said, and i think i said earlier, the comments by general clark, and for that matter general mcpeak, are very unworthy of anyone representing their services, by virtue of their rank. they're playing politics. it's not good. senator (candidate last) apparently is permitting it. and that's very disappointing." <b><u> </u></b></p><p>(candidate last) spokesman brian rogers:  </p><p>brian rogers: "this is not an isolated incident. anybody who reads ben smith's story in the politico this morning will see that moveon.org apparently is involved in this. many elements on the left are circulating in this stuff. and it is written to the level of acceptability. tom harkin's comments a couple of weeks ago, jay rockefeller made some comments, as we said mcpeak, ed shultz calling senator (candidate last) a 'warmonger.' we need to set the record straight because we understand the impact. and who better to do that than these gentlemen who served with senator (candidate last) and understand what the truth is and it's really important. it is clear that it is a pattern and if (candidate full) wants to make that part of his campaign that is his right but let's also dispense with the notion that senator (candidate last) stands for a new kind of politics. it is clear that his words in many cases do not mean very much to him so these pledges about a new kind of politics, changing the discourse, you know let's just dispense with that notion." </p><p><a href="http://blip.tv/file/1037010/"><b><i><u> listen</u></i></b> </a> to the full conference call</p></span>
