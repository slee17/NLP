</p><p>"these are all things that i think an experienced person in foreign policy would have thought their way through, and you wouldn't find as many mistakes being made as are being made here. and i think it illustrates one of the major reasons why (candidate full) is doing so well and i believe will ultimately win the election. the american people want someone who is tried and tested in the conduct of foreign policy and negotiation. we live with many, many challenges foreign and domestic. we need an experienced person. not someone like senator (candidate last), who is one of the least experienced candidates for president in the last 100 years, if not the least experienced. beyond that, his actions as a candidate seem to demonstrate that." </p><p>... <b></b></p><p>randy scheunemann: "just to clarify the news report indicates that ambassador kurtzer met with the syrian foreign minister and this gives you a real insight into one of the core problems with senator (candidate last)'s stated preference for diplomacy consisting of unconditional summit meetings with state sponsors of terrorism and some of the world's worst dictators. the differences, as the mayor pointed out, there's no disclosure with this. the news report indicated that the meeting was arranged by assad's father-in-law, that the costs were underwritten by unnamed syrian corporations, also apparently another foreign oil company. </p><p>"ambassador kurtzer himself raised the question, none of us thought we were being used and abused, but we will see over time. i guess if these news reports are accurate, and assad's father-in-law set the thing up, and syrian corporations paid for it, these aren't exactly impartial entities to organize a conference. let's not forget the country that this conference will be in. syria has not cooperated with the international atomic energy agency, in providing flight access. they are sponsors of some of the worst terrorist organizations in the world, in hezbollah. they stand credibly charged with being behind the assassination of a number of lebanese officials, including former prime minister hariri. a conference in syria and financed by the syrians and organized by relatives of the president and talking about the rule of law is a little bit like sitting down with hamas and talking about their peace plan, except another (candidate last) adviser already did that, and i guess he's since been dismissed by the campaign. </p><p>"it's also interesting that this is revealed that syrian president assad is in moscow shopping for arms, talking about giving the russians access to some of their mediterranean ports, talking about the acquisition of surface to air missiles, the kind of system that might have gravely complicated the apparently successful raid that the israelis launched defensively and appropriately against the suspected syrian nuclear facility last fall. </p><p>"finally, let me just talk about experience a little bit. ambassador kurtzer, you know it wasn't too long ago that he tried to explain senator (candidate last)'s misstep in calling for jerusalem to remain the undivided capital of israel. he said, 'well, he misused the code word. he didn't realize at the time what it meant. that doesn't mean he's nave.' that's a reuters report on kurtzer explaining (candidate last)'s use of jerusalem should be the undivided capital of israel and the next day have to correct that. kurtzer went on to say that he made that mistake because senator (candidate last) had a picture in his mind of jerusalem before 1967 with barbed wire, mind fields and demilitarized zones so he used that word to represent what he didn't want to see again, and realized after that that is a code word in the middle east. if i'm doing my math correctly senator (candidate last) was six years old in 1967, so the picture in his mind was one that was formed at a relatively early age." </p><p><a href="http://www.nysun.com/national/(candidate last)-adviser-offers-some-advice-to-damascus/84260/"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the full story in the new york sun</p></span>
