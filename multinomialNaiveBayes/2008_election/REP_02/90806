<span class="displaytext"> <p>arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full) today issued the following statement on the jobs report: </p><p>"today's news about unemployment is a stark reminder of the economic challenges facing american families. as the worst single monthly increase in the unemployment rate in two decades clearly shows, americans across this country are hurting, and we must act now to support workers, families and employers alike. this means getting our economy back on track by providing immediate tax relief, enacting a home plan to help those facing foreclosure, lowering health care costs, investing in innovation, moving toward energy independence and opening foreign markets to our goods. these policies will help small businesses create the jobs that families need today. the american people cannot afford more inaction from washington. </p><p>"the wrong change for our country would be an economic agenda based upon the policies of the past that advocate higher taxes, bigger government, government-run health care and greater isolationism. to help families at this critical time, we cannot afford to go backward as senator (candidate last) advocates."</p></span>
