<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- (candidate last)-palin 2008 indiana co-chairman luke messer issued the following statement in conjunction with senator (candidate full)'s campaign appearance in lake county, indiana. <p>"it is fitting that (candidate full) chose halloween for his latest visit to indiana, because he masquerades as a moderate when in reality he is the most liberal presidential candidate in modern history. he masks his plan to 'spread the wealth around' with massive tax increases by calling it a 'tax credit,' all the while proposing a trillion dollars in spending on new government programs. </p><p>"as hoosiers peer beyond (candidate full)'s smooth rhetoric, they see a candidate who does not represent traditional hoosier values. (candidate full) is the only candidate for president who supports lower taxes, smaller government and has the record of reform to truly shake up wall street and washington."</p></span>
