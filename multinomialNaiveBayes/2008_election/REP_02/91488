"it involves no effort of independent thought and seems rational because the teacher knows more than his pupils." </p><p>yet mr. russell warned that the habit of passive acceptance is a disastrous one in later life. "it causes men to seek a leader and to accept as a leader whoever is established in that position." </p><p>welcome to the 2008 presidential race. this nation's liberal elite and its predominantly liberal media have anointed as the next president (PARTY NAME) (candidate full), 47, the junior senator of illinois. </p><p>the liberal tutorial is that sen. (candidate last) is a visionary, a man of hope, if not the political equivalent of the second coming. and a plurality of the student body appears to accept this at face value. but (candidate last) has sparse political experience, no executive experience, no leadership experience, really, and woefully little experience at much of anything. </p><p>that is, other than rationalizing quite leftist and collectivist views that include everything from the worst of command economics -- sure to turn recession into depression -- to perverting the u.s. constitution by making it and the supreme court some kind of rule-of-law relative social re-engineering tool. </p><p>talk about manifest danger. </p><p>the only truly experienced leader in this race -- the gentleman whose resume actually is worthy of the phrase -- is (candidate full), 72, war hero, former congressman and longtime u.s. senator of arizona. </p><p>we first endorsed mr. (candidate last) for president in february, long before we knew sen. (candidate last) would be the (PARTY NAME) nominee. but our words then are even more apropos now. </p><p>(candidate full) is fiercely independent. and he makes no apologies for the principles he holds dear, even if they be at odds with the traditional party base. but he has never wavered in his core belief of what (PARTY NAME)ism (with a capital "r") and (PARTY NAME)ism (with a lower-case "r") are all about: </p><p>small government. fiscal discipline. low taxes. a strong defense. and a judiciary that does not legislate from the bench. </p><p>compared with (candidate full)'s long and dangerous statist laundry list of the ever more expansive role government should play in our lives, (candidate full) sums it up quite succinctly, quite effectively and quite nicely, thank you. </p><p>indeed, we have differences that are more than quibbles with some of sen. (candidate last)'s positions. we stridently disagree with his campaign finance and immigration "reform" efforts. and we've told him so face to face. </p><p>but it being, as once was written, a golden rule that one should never judge men by their opinions but rather by what their opinions make of them, it would be imprudent of us to allow our respectful differences to preclude our support. </p><p>thus, we again today wholeheartedly endorse (candidate full) for president of the united states. for it really is time to stand up and fight. </p><p><a href="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/archive/print_596343.html"><b><i>read</i></b></a><b><i>the editorial</i></b></p></span>
