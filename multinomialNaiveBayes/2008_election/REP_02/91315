(candidate full) believes the government needs to take steps to better enforce the equal pay act..." </p><p>(candidate last)'s commitment to federally mandated pay equity stretches from the rockies to wall street and beyond. and yet it seems to have eluded his senate office. compensation figures for his legislative staff reveal that (candidate last) pays women just 83 cents for every dollar his men make. </p><p>a watchdog group called legistorm posts online the salaries for capitol hill staffers. "we have no political affiliations and no political purpose except to make the workings of congress as transparent as possible," its website explains. parsing legistorm's official data, gleaned from the secretary of the senate, offers a fascinating glimpse at pay equity in the world's greatest deliberative body. </p><p>the most recent statistics are for the half-year from oct. 1, 2007 to march 31, 2008, excluding interns and focusing on full-time personnel. for someone who worked only until, say, last feb. 29, extrapolating up to six months' service simplifies this analysis. doubling these half-year figures illustrates how a year's worth of senate employees' paychecks should look. </p><p>based on these calculations, (candidate last)'s 28 male staffers divided among themselves total payroll expenditures of $1,523,120. thus, (candidate last)'s average male employee earned $54,397. </p><p>(candidate last)'s 30 female employees split $1,354,580 among themselves, or $45,152, on average. </p><p>why this disparity? one reason may be the under-representation of women in (candidate last)'s highest-compensated ranks. among (candidate last)'s five best-paid advisors, only one was a woman. among his top 20, seven were women. </p><p>again, on average, (candidate last)'s female staffers earn just 83 cents for every dollar his male staffers make. this figure certainly exceeds the 77-cent threshold that (candidate last)'s campaign website condemns. however, 83 cents do not equal $1. in spite of this 17-cent gap between (candidate last)'s rhetoric and reality, he chose to chide gop presidential contender (candidate full) on this issue. </p><p>(candidate last) responded aug. 31 to alaska gov. sarah palin's (PARTY NAME) vice-presidential nomination. palin "seems like a very engaging person," (candidate last) told voters in toledo, ohio. "but i've got to say, she's opposed -- like (candidate full) is -- to equal pay for equal work. that doesn't make much sense to me." </p><p>(candidate last)'s criticism notwithstanding, (candidate last)'s payment patterns are the stuff of feminist dreams. </p><p>(candidate last)'s 17 male staffers split $916,914, thus averaging $53,936. his 25 female employees divided $1,396,958 and averaged $55,878. </p><p>on average, according to these data, women in (candidate full)'s office make $1.04 for every dollar a man makes. in fact, all other things being equal, a typical female staffer could earn 21 cents more per dollar paid to her male counterpart -- while adding $10,726 to her annual income -- by leaving (candidate full)'s office and going to work for (candidate full). </p><p>how could this be? </p><p>one explanation could be that women compose a majority of (candidate last)'s highest-paid aides. among his top-five best-compensated staffers, three are women. of his 20-highest-salaried employees, 13 are women. the (PARTY NAME) presidential nominee relies on women -- much more than men -- for advice at the highest, and thus, best-paid levels. </p><p>if anyone on (candidate last)'s senate staff is unhappy, (candidate last)'s male staffers might complain they seem to get a slightly raw deal. </p><p>in short, these statistics suggest that (candidate full) is more than fair with his female employees, while (candidate full) -- at the expense of the women who work for him -- quietly perpetuates the very same pay-equity divide that he loudly denounces. of all people, the (PARTY NAME) standard bearer should understand that equal pay begins at home. </p><p><a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/378772_murdockonline12.html"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the op-ed</p></span>
