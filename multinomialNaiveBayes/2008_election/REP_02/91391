(candidate full) is respected around the world because of his national security, military, and foreign affairs experience. the country is struggling economically and in many other ways and we don't need the added pressure of some sort of invitation or temptation by others to see that kind of weakness. this is not coming from me or from somebody on our side, this is coming from his own vice presidential candidate, (candidate full), who repeatedly has suggested (candidate full)'s not ready." </p><p><b>carlson: </b>"well he did at least when he was one of his competitors and they were debating against one another. so, do you think it's still in his mindset that he would say something like this?" </p><p><b>gov. pawlenty: </b>"well, i think senator (candidate last) is sometimes, you know, makes a lot of interesting comments but you see the situation, for example, in georgia or ukraine. there could be temptations by other countries to say look maybe this is a time where we test this potential new president. that kind of temptation wouldn't be as high in my opinion if you had a seasoned experienced known commodity steady hand on the throttle like (candidate full)." </p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wola40ibew4"><b><i>watch</i></b></a><b><i>the interview</i></b></p></span>
