</p><p>i am confident we will find many (PARTY NAME) and independents who, like (candidate full) and me, put country before political party and will support a leader with a real record of bipartisanship. </p><p>time and time again (candidate full) has put his country first. he refused early release when he was held captive in vietnam. he continued to put his country first as a national leader in the u.s. senate. he put country before party when he fought to pass campaign finance reform, sought a bi-partisan solution to the immigration problem, and consistently supported pro-environment policies. his courage to stand up to the failed iraq war plan of secretary of defense donald rumsfeld and lead the fight for a new strategy in iraq will go down in history, and it saved american lives. these were not always the easy things to do. in fact, they were usually very difficult, and often threatened his political career. but (candidate full) did what was right. </p><p>he said it best in his speech in new orleans on tuesday night: <i> </i></p><p>"(the american people) know i have a long record of bipartisan problem solving. they've seen me put our country before any president -- before any party -- before any special interest -- before my own interest. they might think me an imperfect servant of our country, which i surely am. but i am her servant first, last and always."  </p><p>the phones at the campaign headquarters have been ringing with disaffected (PARTY NAME) calling to say they believe senator (candidate last) has the experience, judgment, and bipartisanship necessary to lead our country in these difficult times. many of these supporters are former supporters of senator (candidate last). </p><p>senator (candidate last) has had a very good working relationship with senator (candidate last) and will continue to do so in the future. in the same new orleans speech he said: <i> </i></p><p>"senator (candidate last) has earned great respect for her tenacity and courage. the media often overlooked how compassionately she spoke to the concerns and dreams of millions of americans, and she deserves a lot more appreciation than she sometimes received. as the father of three daughters, i owe her a debt for inspiring millions of women to believe there is no opportunity in this great country beyond their reach. i am proud to call her my friend."  </p><p>i am proud to call (candidate full) my friend and ask you to help our friend become the next president of the united states. </p><p>please forward this email to your lists today and ask your friends, family, and coworkers who do not consider themselves (PARTY NAME)s to join me in filling out the citizens for (candidate last) form today. </p><p>thank you for your willingness to help me expand this new organization. together, we will make history.</p></span>
