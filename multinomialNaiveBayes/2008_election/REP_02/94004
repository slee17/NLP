<span class="displaytext"><p align="left">arlington, va -- today, (candidate last) spokesman tucker bounds issued the following statement in response to (candidate full) admitting that his proposed tax increases will harm our economy:</p><p><i>"(candidate full)'s admission that his tax increases could harm the economy begs the question as to why he supports them. at a time when family budgets in this country are stretched thin and employers are facing tough economic challenges, the idea that (candidate full) would even propose tax increases reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the economy. we will not get our economy back on track by raising income taxes, social security taxes, capital gains and dividend taxes and corporate taxes as (candidate full) proposes. that's change we just can't afford."</i></p><p><b><u>yesterday, (candidate full) admitted that his tax increases will harm the economy:</u></b></p><p><b>(candidate full) admits that his tax increases may harm the economy. </b>cnbc's john harwood: "<u>and i found this fascinating, maria, that on the issue of taxes, he looked to insulate himself by saying that if, in fact, economic conditions justify the fact that it might harm the economy, he might be willing to hold off some of his tax increases when he takes office in january. let's take a listen to (candidate full).</u>" (candidate full): "<u>some of those, you could possibly defer.</u> but i think the basic principle of restoring fairness to our economy and encouraging bottom-up economic growth is important. so here's what we know: we know that over the last decade or so, that more than half of the economic growth has been captured by the top one percent of u.s. citizens. that means the other 99 percent have seen their effective incomes go down. that is not a recipe for long- term economic growth."
