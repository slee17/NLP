<span class="displaytext">saint paul, mn -- today, the 2008 (PARTY NAME) national convention launched the first day of its hurricane gustav relief effort. the effort includes the formation of a center where volunteers will assemble and send 80,000 "comfort packages," a text message alert system, and a comprehensive effort to encourage americans to donate to charities identified by the five gulf coast governors. these efforts augment the steps that the convention announced yesterday, which included the formation of the affected states working group and the establishment of an affected states information center. <p>"we are deeply concerned about the safety and welfare of the residents of the gulf states region. senator (candidate last) has asked us to put country first and shift our focus to assisting the gulf state citizens, and we have coordinated a relief effort that answers his call to service. we are doing what americans do best: helping our fellow citizens in need," said rick davis, campaign manager for (candidate last) 2008. </p><p>chairman of the (PARTY NAME) national committee robert m. "mike" duncan added, "the safety and well-being of the people of the gulf states remains our top concern. over the past 24 hours, we have moved quickly to mobilize people and resources to assist the gulf states' residents -- both those who are in the region and our delegates in saint paul -- in any way we can." </p><p><b>comfort care packages</b> </p><p>the 2008 (PARTY NAME) national convention has joined with target, fedex, and the red cross to send 80,000 "comfort packages" to the gulf coast region. the packages will be assembled at the minneapolis convention center in a staging area being assembled today. the packages will have basic necessities donated by target, including toothpaste, toothbrushes, deodorant, soap, granola bars, and other prepackaged foods. the donated materials will arrive in saint paul on wednesday at 8 a.m., and fedex will ship the packages to the appropriate locations. </p><p>the 2008 (PARTY NAME) national convention is helping coordinate the volunteer effort. we expect 200 volunteers, which will be working in 75 minute shifts beginning on wednesday. </p><p><b>text message alert system</b> </p><p>we have launched a text message alert system to inform delegates and alternates of program changes and other information as soon as it becomes available. the convention is in continuous communication with all delegates, speakers, and program participants. all parties understand that the schedule for the convention will be dictated by the conditions on the ground in the gulf states and are, therefore, subject to change. the campaign and the convention's first priority is the safety and security of those living in the areas where the hurricane will make landfall. </p><p><b>charitable donations</b> </p><p>the governors of the states affected by the hurricane recommended five charitable organizations that americans can donate to if they wish to contribute to the relief efforts. the 2008 (PARTY NAME) national convention is working to coordinate and encourage donations to these groups. in addition, the (candidate last) 2008 campaign has set up a phone bank at the hilton in minneapolis, which will help coordinate donations to these groups. the five groups are as follows: </p><ul> <li><b>louisiana:</b> aidmatrix (<a href="http://www.aidmatrix.org" target="_blank">www.aidmatrix.org</a>) <br/> aidmatrix is a leading aid organization that

back home. there are also representatives in the center that can contact gulf state governors, if needed.</p></span>
