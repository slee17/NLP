<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, john m. murtagh made the following statement on (candidate full)'s relationship with william ayers: <p>"when i was 9 years-old the weather underground, the terrorist group founded by (candidate full)'s friend william ayers, firebombed my house. (candidate full) has dismissed concerns about his relationship with ayers by noting that he was only a child when ayers was planting bombs at the pentagon and the u.s. capitol. but ayers has never apologized for his crimes, he has reveled in them, expressing regret only for the fact that he didn't do more. </p><p>"while (candidate full) once downplayed his relationship with ayers, today his campaign took that deceit one step further. (candidate full) now denies he was even aware of his friend's violent past when, in 1995, ayers hosted a party launching (candidate last)'s political career. given ayers' celebrity status among the left, it's difficult to believe. the question remains: what did (candidate last) know, and when did he know it? when did (candidate last) learn the truth about his friend? (candidate full) helped ayers promote his book in 1997, served on charitable boards with him through 2002, and regularly exchanged emails and phone calls with him through 2005. at what point did (candidate full) discover that his friend was an unrepentant terrorist? and if he is so repulsed by the acts of terror committed by william ayers, why did the relationship continue? any honest accounting by (candidate full) will necessarily cast further doubt on his judgment and his fitness to serve as commander in chief. </p><p>"(candidate full) may have been a child when william ayers was plotting attacks against u.s. targets -- but i was one of those targets. (candidate full)'s friend tried to kill my family." <i> </i></p><p>in february 1970 john murtagh's father was a new york state supreme court justice presiding over the trial of the so-called "panther 21," members of the black panther party indicted in a plot to bomb new york landmarks and department stores. early on the morning of february 21, three gasoline-filled firebombs exploded at their home on the northern tip of manhattan, two at the front door and the third tucked neatly under the gas tank of the family car. the same night, bombs were thrown at a police car in manhattan and two military recruiting stations in brooklyn. a few weeks after the attack, the new york contingent of the weathermen blew themselves up making more bombs in a greenwich village townhouse. in late november that year, a letter to the associated press signed by bernardine dohrn, ayers's wife, promised more bombings. <b> </b></p><p> <a href="http://www.city-journal.org/2008/eon0430jm.html"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a><b><i> john murtagh's account of the weather underground's attack </i></b></p></span>
