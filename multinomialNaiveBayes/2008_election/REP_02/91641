"thus, when (candidate last)'s radio ad says, '(candidate full) has stood in the way ... he's opposed stem cell research,' it is misleading voters by not pointing out that (candidate last) changed his mind on the issue seven years ago and currently supports stem cell research. the ad cleverly uses the word 'has' to imply that (candidate last) still opposes the research -- which is not true."
