"both [(candidate last) and (candidate last)] promised to not raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 or $250,000 a year. they both just emasculated their domestic programs. returning the rich to their (candidate last)-era tax rates will yield, at best, $40 billion a year in revenue. it's impossible to fund a health care plan, let alone anything else, with that kind of money. the consequences are clear: if elected they will have to break their pledge, and thus destroy their credibility, or run a minimalist administration."

"the (candidate last) campaign responds that tax cuts, once enacted, are usually renewed and do not expire. therefore, they say, (candidate last) can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts. (candidate last) has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do."
