<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full)'s presidential campaign today released the following statement from (candidate last) spokesman brian rogers concerning (candidate full)'s remarks on iraq:<p>"since announcing his campaign in 2007, the central premise of (candidate full)'s candidacy was his commitment to begin withdrawing american troops from iraq immediately. he campaigned in iowa, new hampshire and across the country reaffirming this pledge to the american people. </p><p>"today, (candidate full) reversed that position proving once again that his words do not matter. he has now adopted (candidate full)'s position that we cannot risk the progress we have made in iraq by beginning to withdraw our troops immediately without concern for conditions on the ground. there is nothing wrong with changing your mind when the facts on the ground dictate it. indeed, the facts have changed because of the success of the surge that (candidate full) advocated for years and (candidate full) opposed in a position that put politics ahead of country. </p><p>"now that (candidate full) has changed course and proven his past positions to be just empty words, we would like to congratulate him for accepting (candidate full)'s principled stand on this critical national security issue. if he had visited iraq sooner or actually had a one-on-one meeting with general petraeus, he would have changed his position long ago."</p></span>
