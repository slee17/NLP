(candidate last) called the story "overblown and irrelevant." two days later johnson was cashiered. </p><p>of course that's all just campaign mechanics. but (candidate last) has been reversing himself on policy, too. </p><p>in october, the (candidate last) campaign promised that the senator would support a filibuster of any fisa bill that would grant retroactive immunity for telecom companies who helped the government with wiretapping. last week, (candidate last) announced that he would not filibuster the new fisa bill (which contains wiretapping immunity), and that instead he planned to vote for it. </p><p>at a dinner of the american israel public affairs committee, the pro-israel lobby, (candidate last) promised that "jerusalem will remain the capital of israel, and it must remain undivided." later, an (candidate last) adviser clarified that (candidate last) did not mean that jerusalem should be literally "not divided." </p><p>here's the campaign's confusing explanation: "so [(candidate last)] used a word to represent what he did not want to see again, and then realized afterwards that that word is a code word in the middle east." it remains unclear what situation (candidate last) sees as preferable for israel's capital. </p><p>equally unclear is how (candidate last) assesses the nature of iran's threat to america. </p><p>in 2004 he said that iran was more dangerous than the soviet union had been because the radicals in tehran could not be deterred by traditional strategic means. in late may, he changed his mind, saying that iran doesn't "pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us." faced with criticism, (candidate last) then pivoted again, declaring iran to be a "grave threat" to america. </p><p>mind you, this list of reversals excludes (candidate last)'s abandonment of his public financing pledge. it also excludes the more troubling missteps (candidate last) committed last month. </p><p>for instance, (candidate last) argued that america's existing legal system is adequate for dealing with terrorists. in the first attack against the world trade center, he said "we were able to arrest those responsible, put them on trial. they are currently in u.s. prisons, incapacitated." which isn't quite right: one of the terrorists involved in that attack, abdul rahman yasin, fled afterwards to iraq where he worked openly with saddam hussein's regime. </p><p>in a tv ad he debuted last month, (candidate last) boasted of having "extended health care for wounded troops who had been neglected." the law to which he was referring is the 2008 national defense authorization act, which passed the senate 91 to 3. (candidate last) was one of six senators not present to vote for it. </p><p>finally, there is the strange case of (candidate last)'s phone call with iraqi foreign minister hoshay zebari. after their discussion, (candidate last) told reporters that zebari never mentioned the candidate's plan to withdraw american troops from iraq. zebari told a very different story: "my message [to (candidate last)] ... was very clear. ... really, we are making progress. i hope any actions you will take will not endanger this progress." zebari reported that (candidate last) assured him he would "not take any irresponsible, reckless, sudden decisions or action to endanger your gains, your achievements, your stability or security." it's hard to square the differing accounts. </p><p>(candidate last)'s very bad june suggests two possibilities: he may be one of the more unprincipled politicians we've seen recently - remember, (candidate last) once mocked the (candidate last)s for their prevarications, saying "they don't tell you what they mean." or perhaps his mistakes are honest - which would make the (candidate last) campaign one of the more intellectually disorganized enterprises in recent presidential history. </p><p>it's unclear which prospect is greater cause for concern. </p><p><a href="http://www.philly.com/inquirer/opinion/20080704_is_his_campaign_dishonest_or_disorganized_.html"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the op-ed</p></span>
