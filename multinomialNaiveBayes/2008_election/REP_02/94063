<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, (candidate last)-palin 2008 spokesman ben porritt issued the following statement in response to the (candidate last) campaign's letter to attorney general michael mukasey: <p>"after a week of shifting stories and clumsy corrections regarding (candidate full)'s connections to acorn, the (candidate last) campaign resorted to their now-customary heavy handed tactic of attempting to criminalize political discourse. today's outrageous letter to attorney general mukasey and special prosecutor dannehy at the justice department asking for a special prosecutor to investigate senator (candidate last) and governor palin's public statements about acorn's record of fraudulent voter registrations (including in this week's presidential debate) is absurd. it is a typical time-worn washington attempt to criminalize political differences. for someone who promises 'change,' it is certainly only more of the same. </p><p>"the letter's request that the department of justice investigate 'recent partisan (PARTY NAME) activities throughout the country' is almost a parody of the (candidate last) campaign's attempt to intimidate their political opponents. in case sen. (candidate last)'s lawyer did not notice, we are in the midst of a political campaign, not a coronation, and the alleged criminal activity he calls 'recent partisan (PARTY NAME) activities' are what the rest of us call campaign speeches and debates. all of this is unfortunately reminiscent of the (candidate last) campaign's recent creation of a 'truth squad' of missouri prosecutors and sheriffs to 'target' people who criticize sen. (candidate last). rest assured that, despite these threats, the (candidate last)-palin campaign will continue to address the serious issue of voter registration fraud by acorn and other partisan groups, and compliance by states with the help america vote act's requirement of matching new voter registrations with state data bases to preve nt voter fraud."</p></span>
