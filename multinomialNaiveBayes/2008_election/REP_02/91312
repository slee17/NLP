(candidate last) and his congressional allies: ready to block immigration reform, but not ready to lead." </p><p>that is exactly what happened. it was smart but cynical politics. led by senate majority leader harry reid, (PARTY NAME) were able to please the unions and deny a (PARTY NAME) president a huge legislative victory, all the while making it look as if the opposing party was to blame for the debacle. </p><p>luckily, some members of the media kept their eye on the ball and put the blame where it belonged: on reid and the (PARTY NAME). the washington post's david broder, in a column published in june 2007, blasted reid for going "out of his way to rewrite (the immigration bill) to meet the demands of organized labor." </p><p>now, in response to the (candidate last)-palin ad, (PARTY NAME) are practicing revisionist history. sen. robert menendez of new jersey said in a statement released by the (candidate last) campaign: "to say that (candidate full) and senate (PARTY NAME) blocked the bill that (PARTY NAME)s filibustered is hypocritical and not true. (candidate full) has lost his credibility when it comes to the immigration issue. . . . (he) cannot attack (PARTY NAME) on immigration in spanish while pandering to the extreme right tancredo wing of the (PARTY NAME) party in english." </p><p>i understand that menendez is trying to earn (candidate last)'s good graces after being a vocal supporter of (candidate full) in the primaries. but did he really compare (candidate last) to tom tancredo, the nativist congressman who also sought the gop nomination in this year's primaries? </p><p>senator, i know tom tancredo. i've written about tom tancredo. and (candidate full) is no tom tancredo. one of the few things that these men share is a strong dislike for one another. in one debate, (candidate last) described tancredo's explanation of what makes someone an american as "beyond my realm of thinking." </p><p>others on the left are also lending a hand to (PARTY NAME) efforts at damage control. they include groups dedicated to the admirable goal of achieving comprehensive immigration reform. what is not so admirable is the way that these groups have turned on (candidate last), whom not long ago they praised for fighting the good fight on the immigration issue. now they claim that (candidate last) has flip-flopped. </p><p>baloney. they're the ones who flip-flopped, and for no grander reason than because we're in an election year. </p><p>"we are stunned," declared frank sharry, executive director of america's voice, a washington-based liberal-leaning organization in a statement. </p><p>"a spanish-language ad approved by sen. (candidate full) accuses sen. (candidate last) and the (PARTY NAME) of derailing immigration reform? he knows better. the whole political world knows better. comprehensive immigration reform was blocked not by (PARTY NAME) but by (PARTY NAME)s. . . . immigrants and latinos are intelligent. they know the difference between fact and fiction." </p><p>i always appreciate it when non-latinos are patronizing and tell me what i should or shouldn't know. i know this much: some folks inside the beltway are so eager to put a (PARTY NAME) in the white house that they're putting party before truth. </p><p>they include latino groups such as the national council of la raza and the mexican american legal defense and education fund who, as sharry said, should know better. </p><p>during a conference call this week with reporters, nclr vice president cecilia munoz also criticized the ad and called immigration an issue that "tends to determine who the good guys are and the bad guys are for latinos." </p><p>that implies that these advocacy groups can tell the difference. that's the point. blinded by partisanship, they haven't a clue. </p><p><a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/op-ed/navarrette/20080917-9999-lz1e17navarre.html"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the article</p></span>
