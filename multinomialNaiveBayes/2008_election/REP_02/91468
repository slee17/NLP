because not enough americans believed that there was a seriousness of purpose in the federal government to secure the borders. and, until that was done, the unease about that would not allow there to be a consensus and a majority, which is how you get legislation done. but i know senator (candidate last) as president will support, will push and will sign a comprehensive immigration reform bill, just like he supported, in those days, when he was working with us in this effort, in a bipartisan fashion, with people like senator kennedy." </p><p><a href="http://blip.tv/file/1070584/"><b><i>listen</i></b></a><b><i>to the full conference call</i></b></p></span>
