<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, (candidate full) will sit down with cbs news for an interview to be aired on the cbs "evening news." please find below a reminder that while (candidate full) was trying to score political points in the (PARTY NAME) primaries by calling the surge a failure, cbs news was reporting the progress being made in iraq because of the surge: <p align="center"><b><i>(candidate full) on the surge</i></b> </p><p><b><u>in january 2007, (candidate full) opposed the surge: </u></b> </p><p><b>(candidate full) said the surge would actually worsen sectarian violence in iraq. </b>(candidate last): "i am not persuaded that 20,000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there. in fact, i think it will do the reverse. i think it takes pressure off the iraqis to arrive at the sort of political accommodation that every observer believes is the ultimate solution to the problems we face there. so i am going to actively oppose the president's proposal."
