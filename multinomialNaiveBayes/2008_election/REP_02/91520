<span class="displaytext"><p>[e]xactly what kind of change can mr. (candidate last) bring if he's elected in november? </p><p>foreign policy: take mr. (candidate last)'s foreign-policy pronouncements... two doctrines are most prominent. one is to engage our enemies and be nicer to our allies. the other calls for leaving iraq on a set timetable. </p><p>the problem with the first is that key allies like the conservative french, german and italian governments ... now embrace pretty much the same policies we do. britain and the european union just called for imposing tougher sanctions on iran, while france and britain promise more troops for afghanistan. </p><p>in february 2007, mr. (candidate last) called for american troops out of iraq by march 2008. but in the last four months since that proposed final departure, violence is way down: the u.s. military and iraqi army have stabilized much of the country. ... </p><p>the world in january 2009 will not be the same as it was in february 2007. so would a president (candidate last) really engage iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad just as the europeans are isolating him, or give up on iraq when the american military may well gradually draw down in victory, not defeat? </p><p>energy: gas prices are soaring. americans are frustrated... </p><p>yet mr. (candidate last)'s change probably wouldn't include more drilling; more nuclear power plants; or fuel extraction from tar sands, shale or coal. ... </p><p>taxes: mr. (candidate last) also wishes to raise trillions in new taxes by upping the capital-gains margins, restoring inheritance taxes, raising the income rates on the upper brackets and lifting the income caps on social security payroll taxes. ... </p><p>[m]r. (candidate last) promises more vast entitlements in health care, education and housing, and current federal revenues were increased by past tax cuts that spurred economic growth. </p><p>mr. (candidate last) promises a new style of politics that is issue-based, rather than attack-dog. ... </p><p>[but] the take-no-prisoners moveon.org, which gave us the "general betray us" ads, is now an ally running third-party hit pieces on (candidate full). ... </p><p>overall, mr. (candidate last)'s announced policies are sounding pretty much the same old, same old once promised by candidates like george mcgovern, mike dukakis, walter mondale, al gore and john kerry. ... </p><p>so what are the (PARTY NAME) thinking? ... </p><p>in other words, we should count on hope rather than change. </p><p>to view the entire article, please visit: <a href="http://washingtontimes.com/news/2008/jun/20/what-kind-of-change-34788996" target="_blank"><i>the washington times</i></a></p></span>
