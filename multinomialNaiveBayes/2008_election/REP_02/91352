(candidate last) supported all of them.<br/> </p><p>the afl-cio also points to a (candidate last) vote against a war spending supplemental appropriations measure from 2007 that included additional funding for veterans' health care, along with much else. the measure passed the senate along partisan lines but was vetoed by president bush. but (candidate last) voted for a later version of the supplemental that ultimately passed into law and actually included slightly more funding for veterans' benefits. <br/> </p><p><u><br/><b><i>analysis</i></b><br/></u>the afl-cio attack ad against (candidate full) starting airing today and is the first ad the labor federation has run in the 2008 presidential campaign. it will run in michigan, minnesota, ohio, pennsylvania, virginia and wisconsin for the next three weeks, according to a report in the washington post. </p><p>we find the ad, narrated by vietnam veteran jim wasser, to be unduly harsh on (candidate last)'s voting record on veterans' health benefits.<br/> </p><p><u><br/><b><i>(candidate last)'s votes</i></b><br/></u>the ad says that (candidate last) "took bush's side against increasing health care benefits for veterans." but he actually voted to increase veterans' health care benefits, though not by as much as (PARTY NAME) proposed. </p><p>the afl-cio, in documentation it provided to factcheck.org, cites four specific votes as support for this allegation. three of them were against (PARTY NAME) amendments to the annual budget bill in 2004, 2005 and 2006. and all of them failed along party lines in a (PARTY NAME)-controlled senate. but in each case, (candidate last) later supported different amendments to increase veterans' health benefits, either on the same day or the following day. </p><p>specifically, in 2004 (candidate last) voted against an increase of $1.8 billion, but an increase of $1.2 billion passed by unanimous consent. in 2005 he voted against an increase of $2.8 billion, then voted for a $410 million increase. and in 2006, he voted against a $1.5 billion increase, then voted for an $823 million increase. </p><p>there was no dissent for the 2004 amendment, and the 2006 amendment passed unanimously. in 2005, the alternative spending increase passed with a healthy 96-to-4 bipartisan stamp of approval. also, it's worth mentioning that the president does not express an opinion on every amendment offered in the senate. so it is not accurate to say (candidate last) "took bush's side" on these votes. </p><p>the union group also cites a fourth vote, a march 2007 vote by (candidate last) against a war spending supplemental that passed the senate but was vetoed by the president. the bill did include $1.77 billion in additional funding for veterans' health care benefits. however, (candidate last) voted for an alternative version of the supplemental that was quickly introduced, passed and signed into law. and it actually included slightly more money for veterans' health benefits, $1.79 billion.<br/> </p><p><u><br/><b><i>$10 billion a month?<br/></i></b></u>the ad also says that (candidate last) "wants us to keep spending ten billion dollars a month in iraq, just like bush." it is true that the u.s. is spending $10 billion or more per month in iraq, according to most estimates. and (candidate last) has certainly resisted any "retreat" from iraq, and he has even said u.s. troops could remain for decades. but strictly speaking, (candidate last) has never said that he wants to spend $10 billion per month in iraq. quite the contrary. </p><p>in fact, (candidate last) says he's counting on reduced spending for military operations to help him balance the federal budget. in his "jobs for america" plan released july 9, the (candidate last) campaign said: </p><p>(candidate last) campaign: the (candidate last) administration would reserve all savings from victory in the iraq and afghanistan operations in the fight against islamic extremists for reducing the deficit. since all their costs were financed with deficit spending, all their savings must go to deficit reduction. </p><p>we can't predict whether (candidate last), or for that matter, (candidate last), will actually be able to cut spending in iraq. but it's simply wrong to say (candidate last) "wants" to continue spending at the current level, when he's said he wants to reduce it. </p><p><b><i><u>sources<br/></u></i></b>cillizza, chris, "afl-cio goes after (candidate last) in battleground states," washington post. 9 july 2008. </p><p>108th congress, u.s. senate,
