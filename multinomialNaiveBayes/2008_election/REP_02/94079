<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, (candidate last) spokesman brian rogers issued the following statement on (candidate full)'s remarks at the naleo conference where he conveniently glossed over his record of putting politics ahead of reforming our immigration system:<p><i>"it's quite audacious for (candidate full) to question (candidate full)'s commitment to immigration reform when it was (candidate last) himself who worked to kill the senate's bipartisan immigration reform compromise last year. (candidate full) voted for five 'poison pill' amendments designed by special interests to kill the immigration reform deal. these efforts were strongly opposed by senator ted kennedy (d-ma), the (PARTY NAME) who led the fight for immigration reform, because he understood they would have the effect of ending the bipartisan work toward immigration reform.</i></p><p>"the reality is that (candidate full) has never reached across the aisle to lead in a bipartisan fashion on an issue of major importance to the american people when his own political interests were at risk. the american people are tired of typical politicians like (candidate full). while (candidate full) was reaching across the aisle to solve the tough problem of immigration reform, (candidate full) was working for politics as usual in washington."</p><p><b><u>fact check: (candidate last) put politics first and supported "poison pill" efforts to kill the immigration reform compromise last year</u></b></p><p><b><i>the weekly standard's</i> fred barnes: "(candidate last) professes in speeches and his bestselling book, the audacity of hope, to rise above crass party interests. not this time."</b> "where was (candidate full)? the moment was perfect last week for the illinois senator and champion of bipartisanship to step forward and help save the compromise immigration bill from a premature death. all he needed to do was switch his vote to oppose an amendment whose passage was going to shatter the senate coalition that negotiated the bill. by switching, (candidate last) would have substantiated his claim to be a politician eager to reach across the partisan aisle and end the bitter polarization in washington. but (candidate last) was not heard from. a day later, with the deliberations on the bill in turmoil, senate majority leader harry reid yanked it off the senate floor. (candidate last) voted with reid on cloture, which failed, prompting the shutdown. it may be unfair to single ou t (candidate last) for backing a so-called poison pill that would have weakened the proposed temporary worker program (by terminating it after five years). (candidate last) wasn't alone. two (PARTY NAME) presidential candidates--(candidate full) and (candidate full)--voted with him, as did reid, chuck schumer, and dick durbin, reid's colleagues in the senate (PARTY NAME) leadership. what made (candidate last)'s vote different was his hypocrisy. the others are hard-core partisans.
