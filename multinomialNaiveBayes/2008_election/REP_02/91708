<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, with senator (candidate full)'s remarks to the aipac policy conference where he proposed a policy that conflicts with the advice of our commanders on the ground, (candidate last) spokesman tucker bounds issued the following statement: <i> </i><p>"it's been 878 days since (candidate full) has visited iraq and that fact shows through every day. (candidate full)'s belief that the arbitrary withdrawal of american troops from iraq would counter iranian influence is simply not credible. it would result in a failed iraqi state which would only make iran stronger not weaker. (candidate full) was wrong to say the surge would fail, wrong to vote against funding our troops in the field and he is wrong to disregard the advice of our commanders." <b><u> </u></b></p><p>today, (candidate full) said that the u.s. troop presence in iraq is strengthening iran and repeated his call for an arbitrary withdrawal of our troops:  </p><p>at aipac, (candidate full) said our troop presence in iraq is strengthening iran. (candidate last): "senator (candidate last) offers a false choice: stay the course in iraq, or cede the region to iran. i reject this logic because there is a better way. keeping all of our troops tied down indefinitely in iraq is not the way to weaken iran - it is precisely what has strengthened it. it is a policy for staying, not a plan for victory. i have proposed a responsible, phased redeployment of our troops from iraq. we will get out as carefully as we were careless getting in. we will finally pressure iraq's leaders to take meaningful responsibility for their own future." ((candidate full), remarks at aipac, washington, d.c., 6/4/08) <b><u> </u></b></p><p>on april 8, 2008, general david petraeus testified against a "set withdrawal timetable" so that our forces have the flexibility they need to "preserve the still-fragile security gains" and promote the "gradual establishment of sustainable security in iraq"  </p><p>general david petraeus further testified that a failed iraq would have "serious consequences for the efforts to counter malign iranian influence." "a failed state in iraq would pose serious consequences for the greater fight against al qaeda, for regional stability, for the already existing humanitarian crisis in iraq and for the efforts to counter malign iranian influence. it clearly is in our national interest to help iraq prevent the resurgence of al qaeda in the heart of the arab world, to help iraq resist iranian encroachment on its sovereignty, to avoid renewed ethnosectarian violence that could spill over iraq's borders and make the existing refugee crisis even worse, and to enable iraq to expand its role in the regional and global economies."

(candidate last): "finally, in 2006-2007, we started to see that, even after an election, george bush continued to want to pursue a course that didn't withdraw troops from iraq but actually doubled them and initiated a search and at that stage i said very clearly, not only have we not seen improvements, but we're actually worsening, potentially, a situation there. and since that time, i've been absolutely clear in terms of the approach that i would take. i would end this war, and i would have our troops out within 16 months."
