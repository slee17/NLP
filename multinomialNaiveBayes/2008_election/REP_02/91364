(candidate last) was the second largest recipient of campaign cash from the government mortgage giants. </p><p>mr. (candidate last) replied that he "never promoted fannie mae" and that "two years ago i said that we've got a subprime lending crisis that has to be dealt with." and that's not all. "i wrote to secretary paulson, i wrote to federal reserve chairman bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it," said the illinois senator. </p><p>there's more. mr. (candidate last)'s march 2007 letter included a stirring call to "assess options" and boldly suggested that the two men "facilitate a serious conversation" about housing. he was even brave enough to suggest that "the relevant private sector entities and regulators" might be able to provide "targeted responses." then in paragraph four, the harvard-trained lawyer dropped his bombshell: a suggestion that various interest groups get together to "consider" best practices in mortgage lending. </p><p>some may find it hard to believe that mr. (candidate last) had nothing to show for this herculean effort to shake up washington. they may be shocked as well that such passionate language didn't move the fed and treasury to action. for our part, we note that nowhere in his letter did mr. (candidate last) suggest that the government should stop subsidizing loans to people who can't repay them. </p><p>this is the latest fad among beltway liberals who spent years encouraging noneconomic mortgage loans. they now proudly announce that at critical moments they issued a press release, or wrote someone, suggesting that somebody do something. since soured mortgage loans are a root cause of this panic, and since (PARTY NAME) did so much to encourage mortgage lending, the most politically useful of these archived warnings are the ones blaming something other than housing. </p><p>for example, recent media reports have lauded the prescience of edward markey, the massachusetts (PARTY NAME) who has long called for increased regulation of financial derivatives. not that this says much about derivatives. mr. markey has also called for increased regulation of the internet, cable tv, telephones, prescription drugs, nuclear plants, natural gas facilities, oil drilling, air cargo containers, chlorine, carbon dioxide, accounting, advertising and amusement parks, among other things. </p><p>but derivatives are the irresistible story now, because they offer the opportunity to shift the blame from bad housing policy, and they suggest that a lack of financial regulation was the problem. while lauding mr. markey, the media also cast brooksley born, bill (candidate last)'s chairman of the commodity futures trading commission, as the ultimate heroine in this drama. like horatio at the bridge, she tried to regulate the derivatives market over the objections of such dummies as (candidate last) treasury secretary robert rubin, sec chief arthur levitt, and federal reserve chairman alan greenspan. </p><p>the left's hope is that derivatives are so poorly understood that people can be convinced that turmoil in the market for credit default swaps -- an effect of soured mortgage loans -- is actually a cause of this crisis. credit default swaps (cds) are insurance policies against companies or investment vehicles going bankrupt and being unable to pay their creditors. this insurance is cheap when things are going well, and very expensive when investors expect the relevant entities to fail. turns out that the markets for cds and other derivatives not tied to the housing crisis are functioning normally. </p><p>meanwhile, in an amazing coincidence, it is the failure -- or the expected failure -- of entities with heavy exposure to toxic mortgages that is putting extreme financial strain on those who sold insurance. but the problem can't possibly be the toxic mortgages encouraged by washington, according to the politicians. it must be the system of insuring against the collapse of those who bought the mortgages. </p><p>did many sellers of credit default swaps make horrendous judgments in assessing the likelihood of defaults? yes, and they were encouraged to make these poor judgments by government-approved credit-rating agencies stamping approval on mortgage-backed securities. if an investment or commercial bank was holding assets branded rock-solid by government's anointed judges of creditworthiness, who wouldn't feel comfortable insuring against their failure? </p><p>much of the subprime disaster could have been avoided if only the credit raters had never agreed to slap the aaa tag on collateralized debt obligations (cdos). almost no one understood these instruments, which contained portions from other pools of mortgage-backed securities, but with even less transparency. most investors around the world had never heard of a cdo before the housing boom. but they knew what aaa meant. they had been told for years by the government's chosen credit raters that this label meant sound, conservative investing. highly unlikely to default. </p><p>if (candidate full) wants to write any more letters, he should urge his colleagues in washington to focus on the causes of this crisis, not the effects. unlike senators, presidents are expected to solve problems, not merely write about them. </p><p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/sb122523804578478175.html?mod=todays_us_opinion"><b><i>read</i></b></a><b><i>the editorial</i></b></p></span>
