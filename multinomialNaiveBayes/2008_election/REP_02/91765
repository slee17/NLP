"first, let's talk about chechnya. the chechen people are now subjected to a level of slaughter and massacre that we have not seen in europe, perhaps since world war ii. the mindless slaughters being conducted by a russian military that seeks to reassert itself not only in the former soviet union, but also to extend its reach throughout what used to be the former soviet union in an attempt to fold back into the russian empire those countries that have broken away from it, most notably georgia, which is headed by one the great men in the history of the world, mr. shevardnadze. also, t his obviously has a great effect on the next election in russia. the russian prime minister now is playing this to a great political gain. the russians must be told that they will not only not be anymore imf funding, there will not be any more export/import funding, and the united states will gauge its relations on the treatment of the chechnans because what is happening right now is an unconscionable set of circumstances which if allowed to continue will then encourage russia and the military to continue to this kind of expansion into the region and overthrow the embryonic nations that are there. the russians have to understand that this is not something that we can turn a blind eye to, and we must have it stopped. otherwise, it will have severe implications for our relations for years to come."
