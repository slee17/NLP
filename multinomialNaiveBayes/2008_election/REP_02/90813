<span class="displaytext"><b>arlington, va --</b> u.s. senator (candidate full) issued the following statement on today's verdict in the case of salim ahmed hamdan: <p>"i welcome today's guilty verdict in the first trial held under the military commissions act (mca). this process of bringing terrorists to justice has been too long delayed, but i'm encouraged that it is finally moving forward. i supported that legislation, which was a good-faith effort by congress to meet the supreme court's direction to establish a process to bring terrorist detainees to trial. salim ahmed hamdan, a trusted confidante of osama bin laden, was provided a full hearing of the charges against him and was represented by counsel who vigorously defended him. the jury found that the prosecution lawyers had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that hamdan had aided terrorists by supplying weapons to al qaeda and taliban forces in afghanistan. this process demonstrated that military commissions can effectively bring very dangerous terrorists to justice. the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully. unlike senator (candidate last) who voted against the mca and favors giving al qaeda terrorists direct access to u.s. civilian courts to contest their detention, i recognize that we cannot treat dangerous terrorists captured on the battlefield as we would common criminals."</p></span>
