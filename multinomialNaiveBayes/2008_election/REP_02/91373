(candidate full) confirmed during a primary debate that he knew ayers and when pressed, said they served on a charitable foundation board together. and (candidate last) condemned ayers support of violence. but the relationship between (candidate last) and ayers went much deeper, ran much longer, and was much more political than (candidate last) said." <b></b></p><p>(candidate last) senior adviser anita dunn: "what they are arguing is that somehow the fact that these two people who served both educational reformers in chicago, both of whom did have their paths cross professionally as well as neighbors occasionally. but somehow this association is a problem for (candidate full) because of bill ayers past and things that happened in the 1960s when (candidate full) was 7 years old. </p><p>"and that's just wrong and, frankly, it's quite unfair." <b></b></p><p>griffin: "one place their paths repeatedly crossed, according to a cnn review of board minutes and other records, was chicago's annenberg challenge project where a $50 million grant from the annenberg foundation matched locally raised funds to improve schools. </p><p>"according to participants and project records, bill ayers fought to bring the annenberg grant to chicago, (candidate full) was recruited as its chair. for seven years, bill ayers and (candidate last) among many others, worked on funding for education projects, including some experiments supported by ayers. </p><p>"stanley kurtz, a conservative researcher for the ethics and public policy center has also been reviewing the recently released records of chicago's annenberg's challenge." <b></b></p><p>national review online's stanley kurtz: "instead of giving money directly to schools, they gave money to what they called external partners, and these external partners were often pretty radical community organizer groups." <b></b></p><p>griffin: "and the board gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to bill ayers' small schools project promoting alternative education like 'the peace school,' where the curriculum centered around a united nations theme, and another school where the focus was, african- american studies. </p><p>"and this was directly funded by annenberg?" <b></b></p><p>kurtz: "oh, yes." <b></b></p><p>griffin: "under (candidate last)'s chairmanship?" <b></b></p><p>kurtz: "oh yes and the specific job of the board of directors was to give out the money." <b></b></p><p>griffin: "while continuing work on the annenberg challenge, (candidate full) and bill ayers also served together on a second charitable foundation, the woods fund. among its recipients, jeremiah wright's trinity united church where (candidate last) attended and a children and family justice center, where ayers' wife worked. ayers has strong defenders in chicago, among them richard daly, the mayor, who called ayers a valued member of the chicago community. the city gave ayers its citizen of the year award in 1997 for his work on the annenberg project. </p><p>"for (candidate last), the chairmanship of the $100 million annenberg board, helped vault him from southside chicago lawyer to political player. and that, too, has another connection to bill ayers. </p><p>"in 1995, months after the little known (candidate full) became annenberg project chair, state senator alice palmer introduced the young (candidate last) as her political heir apparent. </p><p>"where was that introduction made? at the home of the '60s radicals, bill ayers and bernardine dohrn. the (candidate last) campaign again says it is just a coincidence." <b></b></p><p>dunn: "a (PARTY NAME) state senator organizes a meeting of her supporters at the house of another one of her supporters. what is the problem here, drew? it is the worst kind of inference and the worst kind of politics to say that somehow that says something about (candidate full)." <b></b></p><p>griffin: "anderson, this meeting at bill ayers home has been classified in many different ways. what i can tell you from the two people who were actually there, is number one, former senator alice palmer says she, in no way organized this meeting and she was invited and attended it briefly. and doctor quentin young, a retired doctor, told us this indeed was (candidate full)'s political coming out party and it was hosted by bill ayers." <b></b></p><p>cooper: "so drew, i mean bottom line, if (candidate last) and ayers worked together with others to -- i guess improve schools, what exactly is the (candidate last)-palin camp saying is wrong with this relationship or this working relationship? or however you want to characterize it?" <b></b></p><p>griffin: "well anderson, i haven't contacted the campaign on this issue. what they're saying on the stump is the same thing that (candidate full) brought up during the primary campaign is the issue of trust. </p><p>"by raising this issue of bill ayers, and whether or not (candidate full) was hanging around him, palling around with him, or just working with him, bill ayers in the '60s had a very, very different view of the united states that many americans did. a lot of americans were against the vietnam war but not a lot of americans formed a group and started bombing things because of it. </p><p>"now, they're trying to say that that raises judgment issues on (candidate full). which has been the tag other campaigns and now (candidate last)'s have been trying to peg on him ever since he started running for president." <b></b></p><p>cooper: "but (candidate full) has publicly stated he does not agree with this guy?" <b></b></p><p>griffin: "correct. well, he has said that he does -- i forget his exact words but he's certainly deplores the violence in the past." <b></b></p><p>cooper: "right." <b></b></p><p>griffin: "i haven't been able to ask him directly about the relationship he has or had with bill ayers." <b><i></i></b></p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi7pumbaini"><b><i><u> watch</u></i></b> </a><b><i>the cnn report </i></b></p></span>
