<span class="displaytext"><b>arlington, va-- </b>colonel jack jackson, usmc (ret.) today issued the following statement on gen. wesley clark's attack on (candidate full)'s military service record on cbs' "face the nation":<p>"as a marine pilot who served in vietnam, i am deeply concerned about the disgraceful remarks from (candidate full)'s campaign surrogate, gen. wesley clark, regarding (candidate full)'s military service. (candidate full) is proud of his record of always putting the country first from his time in the navy, in vietnam, and through to today. being in command of a military squadron, regardless of whether the country is at war or peace, requires the true leadership that is necessary when assuming total responsibility for the well-being of the men and women in one's unit. (candidate full)'s military experiences solely qualify him to be commander-in-chief when compared to any other candidate running for president of the united states. </p><p>"having gone down in a helicopter myself in vietnam, i know firsthand what is required to stay cool under fire. when (candidate full) was shot down, there is no doubt that he was in total control of the situation and made all the right decisions under fire. i personally feel betrayed by gen. clark's statements against (candidate full). and when (candidate full) allows his surrogates to attack (candidate full)'s military record, it simply proves that (candidate full) is to be nothing more than a typical politician who will say anything to get elected."</p><p><b><i>colonel jack jackson</i></b><i> flew more than 600 combat missions in vietnam, receiving several campaign medals as well as four distinguished flying crosses, 33 air medals, the navy commendation medal (with combat v). upon returning from vietnam, col. jackson was a test pilot for the united states military and later the boeing company, becoming the nation's most experienced verti cal/short take-off and landing (vsotl) pilot. col. jackson was elected to the missouri house of representatives in 2002 and received "legislator of the year" awards from the missouri veterans of foreign wars in 2003, 2005 and 2006.</i> </p><p><b><u>background:</u></b> </p><p><b>yesterday on cbs' "face the nation," wesley clark attacked (candidate full)'s military service.</b> clark: "but he hasn't held executive responsibility. that large squadron in the navy that he commanded? it wasn't a wartime squadron. he hasn't been there and ordered the bombs to fall. he hasn't seen what it's like when diplomats come in and say, 'i don't know whether we're going to be able to get this point through or not, do you want to take the risk, what about your reputation, how do we handle this publicly?' he hasn't made those points bob."
