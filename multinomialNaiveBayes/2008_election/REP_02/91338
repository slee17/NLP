(yes, she is anti-abortion. and yes, instead of buying organic new zealand lamb at whole foods, she joins other alaskans in hunting for food. that's it. she is not a right-wing nut, and all the rest of the internet drivel---the book banning at the library, the rape kits decision---is nonsense. i digress.) palin's role in this campaign was to energize "the (PARTY NAME) base," which she has inarguably done. she also was expected to reach out to (candidate full) "moderates." (right. only a woman would get both those jobs in either party.) look, i am obviously personally pro-choice, and i disagree with (candidate last) and palin on that and a few other issues. but like many other (PARTY NAME), including lynn rothschild, i'm tired of the (PARTY NAME) party taking women fo r granted. i also happen to believe sarah palin supports women's rights, deeply and passionately. </p><p>many of those---not all---who decried the sexist media treatment of (candidate full) have been silent as palin has been skewered in the old ways that female public figures are skewered, as well as a host of sexualized new ways as well. some feminists have weighed in; "even the reportedly clear glasses she wears to play down her beauty queen credential and enhance her gravitas can't make up for experience," writes my heroine suzanne braun levine, former editor of ms. oppose her on policy? fine. but how sad for feminist leaders to sink this low, especially when palin has worn glasses since she was 10 years old. </p><p>last month a prominent feminist blogger, echoing that sensibility, declared that the media was wrongly buying into the false idea that palin was a feminist. why? well, just because she said she was a feminist, because she supported women's rights and opportunities, equal pay, title iv---that was just "empty rhetoric," they said. at least the blogger didn't go as far as now's kim gandy and declare that palin was not a woman. bottom line: you are not a feminist until we say you are. and there you have the formula for diminishing what was once a great and important mass social change movement to an exclusionary club that rejects women who sincerely want to join and, god forbid, grow to lead. </p><p>but here is the good news: women, citizens of america's high and low culture, the economist and people magazine readers, will get it. they got it with hillary even when feminist leaders were not supporting her or doing so half-heartedly. yes, palin is a harder sell, she looks and sounds different, and one can rightfully oppose her based on abortion policies. if you only vote on how a person personally feels about abortion, you will never want her to darken your door. if you care about anything else, she will continue to intrigue you. as time's nancy gibbs noted a few weeks ago, quoting bioethicist tom murray, "sympathy and subtlety are seasonings rarely applied to political red meat." will palin's time come next week? i don't know. but her time will come. </p><p><b><i><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2008-10-27/sarah-palins-a-brainiac/1/">read</a> the post</i></b></p></span>
