<span class="displaytext"><b></b><p>"when assumptions meet facts"<br/>by douglas holtz-eakin<br/><i>national review online<br/></i>april 22, 2008 </p><p>in tuesday's <i>wall street journal</i>, reporter laura meckler provides an attack on (candidate full)'s economic plans in the guise of a news article. meckler asserts that to improve tax policy, (candidate full) would either have to let the deficit explode or make unprecedented, huge spending curbs. however, as is usually the case, meckler's conclusions derive directly from her assumptions, where contrary facts are either forgotten or downplayed. </p><p>nowhere in the article does meckler mention that (candidate full) has explicitly addressed entitlement spending and the need for action to cut spending today. (candidate full) has promised to address social security by demanding that congress deal with the problem, or he will send a bill to them for an up or down vote. also, (candidate last)'s health care reform plan will act to control out-of-control costs which are fueling medicare and medicaid spending. by addressing entitlements now, (candidate full) can reduce federal spending today and prevent meckler's doomsday scenario. </p><p>meckler's scenario also fails to address the basic budget situation that the united states finds itself in today. under the current director, peter orzag, the congressional budget office issued a long-term budget outlook demonstrating that even under current laws for revenues (i.e., the huge (PARTY NAME)' huge tax increase planned for 2011) spending in the federal budget explodes well beyond any feasible revenues. the united states cannot tax its way out of this fiscal challenge. we must cut spending and (candidate full) alone has been honest about our future scenario. the basic facts are that no matter what we must cut spending. </p><p>the article's review of "history" fails to note that (candidate full)'s economic proposals will fuel growth in the economy and that is central to success. discretionary spending as a fraction of gdp fell from 10 percent in 1986 to 6.3 percent in 2000 -- the equivalent of about $500 billion right now and much more than (candidate full) is proposing. this is proof that it is possible to restrain spending and that we must promote rapid economic growth. that is exactly what (candidate full)'s proposals will do. if we expand our economy, we can bring in additional revenue (as the reduction in the capital-gains tax has done). </p><p>the article suggests that these proposals represent the final form of (candidate last)'s vision for a better tax code (even though we are a long way from november) and implicitly assumes that these fundamental reforms would be implemented overnight. that is at odds with any realistic assessment of the implantation of a tax reform. </p><p>finally, meckler presents "independent" sources to back up basic assumptions that are not really independent or relevant at all. the center for budget and policy priorities is liberal-leaning and the concord coalition has largely lost relevancy. yet, these are the only two sources quoted. why didn't meckler reach out to the heritage foundation, cato institute, or the american enterprise institute for a more balanced piece? </p><p>at the end of the day, (candidate full)'s economic plan might not satisfy this reporter's assumptions, but it does the facts. <i></i></p><p>-- douglas holtz-eakin is a (candidate last) senior policy adviser.  </p><p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/print/?q=n2i1otljnwu3mzrknzgyytmxywy4yjvhytjhmgfjmmm="><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the op-ed on national review online</p></span>
