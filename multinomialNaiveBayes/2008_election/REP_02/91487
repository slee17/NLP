"but given the legitimate threats we face, providing effective intelligence-collection tools with appropriate safeguards is too important to delay," he said. </p><p>the calculations that mark (candidate last)'s delicate approach toward the fisa bill and the supreme court gun ruling come on the heels of his decision last week to reverse a pledge he made last year to participate in the public financing system in the general election if his (PARTY NAME) opponent agreed to do the same-a move that made him the first modern presidential candidate to decline public financing in a general election. </p><p>(candidate last) has agreed to participate in the system, which provides candidates $84 million in taxpayer cash, but limits their campaign spending to that amount. (candidate last), whose historic fundraising ability was unknown when he made the pledge, is expected to easily surpass that tally. </p><p>though he did not frame it as such, (candidate last)'s reversal was widely viewed by campaign finance reformers and editorial boards as a strategic choice to put his likely huge campaign cash advantage over his commitment to government reform. </p><p>they've been mostly receptive to (candidate last)'s forays on campaign finance issues, but many reformers dismissed his explanation for the shift: that his massive base of small online donors constitute a "parallel public financing," and that he needed to exit the program to defend himself from the independent spending of 527 groups. </p><p>(candidate last)'s decision to opt out of the public financing program followed his campaign's earlier derailment of another bold campaign proposal he had at one time supported: (candidate last)'s call for a series of town halls featuring the two candidates. </p><p>after declaring last month he would meet (candidate last) "anywhere, anytime" to debate foreign policy-a risky proposition that had the potential to work to (candidate last)'s political advantage--(candidate last) backtracked and would only offer one town hall and one extra debate in response to (candidate last)'s suggestion of 10. </p><p>in explaining the offer to the (candidate last) campaign, (candidate last) campaign manager david plouffe said in a statement that (candidate last)'s offer "would have been the most of any presidential campaign in the modern era - offering a broad range of formats - and representing a historic commitment to openness and transparency." </p><p>he charged (candidate last)'s campaign "would rather contrive a political issue than foster a genuine discussion about the future of our country." </p><p><a href="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=c6d9a9b8-3048-5c12-007ecb3f0699e3eb"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the politico story</p></span>
