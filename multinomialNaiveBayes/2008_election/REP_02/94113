<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full) today issued the following statement on north korea: <p>"reports indicate that the administration may soon remove north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. i have previously said that i would not support the easing of sanctions north korea unless the united states is able to fully verify the nuclear declaration pyongyang submitted on june 26. it is not clear that the latest verification arrangement will enable us to do so. </p><p>"i am also concerned that this latest agreement appears to have been reached between washington and pyongyang and only then discussed with our asian allies in an effort to garner their support. diplomacy is a critical tool in ending the north korean nuclear weapons program, and it must involve our closest partners in northeast asia. while we conduct this diplomacy, we must keep our goal in sight -- the verifiable denuclearization of north korea -- and avoid reaching for agreement for its own sake, particularly if it leaves critical verification issues unaddressed. i am also concerned that recent negotiations appear not to have addressed the issue of north korean abductions of japanese citizens, a serious omission and directly relevant to any decision about north korea's support for terrorist activities. </p><p>'as this process moves forward, i expect the administration to explain exactly how this new verification agreement advances american interests and those of our allies before i will be able to support any decision to remove north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism."</p></span>
