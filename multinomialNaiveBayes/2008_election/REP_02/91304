we found that (candidate full)'s candor, commitment to country and, most of all, his independence reflects the political spirit of most granite state residents. that last point -- independence -- is of particular interest to me. i judge candidates based on their qualifications, not their party. although i've supported several (PARTY NAME) over the years -- including john kerry in his 2004 presidential campaign and john lynch in all of his campaigns for governor -- i recently agreed to serve as co-chair of new hampshire independents for (candidate full).</p><p>our local group, which is part of the national organization "citizens for (candidate last)," is spreading the word across new hampshire about (candidate full)'s long record of putting the nation's interests ahead of politics. based on (candidate full)'s many acts of political courage, we have a compelling story to tell.</p><p>throughout his time in public life, (candidate last) has never been afraid to buck his party and the status quo in washington. eager to work across party lines, (candidate last) joined with (PARTY NAME) sen. russell feingold to fix america's broken campaign finance system. last year, (candidate last) teamed up with sen. ted kennedy to try to reform our immigration laws. and before it became popular to criticize george bush on how the war in iraq was managed, (candidate last) was one of the first (PARTY NAME)s to call for a change in the administration's military strategy.</p><p>as (candidate full) has said many times, he did not go to washington to win the prize for congeniality. by putting principle over politics, (candidate last) has rightfully been declared a true maverick. the majority of voters here in new hampshire, and throughout the nation, prefer a leader who is not afraid of taking positions because they are the "right thing to do" for this country, rather than caving in to special interests or their respective political party's line.</p><p>his record as an independent reformer makes our job of rallying new hampshire independents to (candidate full)'s candidacy a straightforward endeavor. simply put, (candidate full) can point to a strong record of bipartisan achievement -- one that appeals to (PARTY NAME), independents and (PARTY NAME)s.</p><p>(candidate full) has laid out a vision for our country that meets challenges head-on and aims to deliver the change we need. a few examples are worth noting. defying party labels, he believes global climate change is the single greatest environmental challenge of our time and has called for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>recognizing that members of both parties have abandoned their responsibility to taxpayers, (candidate last) will stop runaway federal spending and eliminate wasteful programs. he wants to unleash the american economy by keeping taxes low while also modernizing programs that help workers obtain the skills they need to compete in the global marketplace.</p><p>and he wants to lead america to energy independence through a comprehensive program that relies on green and proven energy sources.</p><p>it's an ambitious agenda, but (candidate full) has spent his entire career fighting to do what's right for his country and delivering real results.</p><p>(candidate full)'s record and life story make him a natural fit for new hampshire's independent voters. based on his unimpeachable character, independents know they can trust (candidate last) to do what is right for our country -- in good times and in bad. bringing forth a new day in our national political life, (candidate last) will bring "straight talk" to the white house and will set to work on america's challenges with tested leadership only he can provide.</p><p>our country has a real choice in this election. while (candidate full) talks of change, always in a very eloquent manner, (candidate full) has shown he knows how to deliver change. new hampshire voters, who have all but trademarked the word "independent," can easily differentiate between the two. as (candidate last)'s campaign has said: don't just hope for a better life, vote for one. i encourage my fellow independents to give their strong consideration to (candidate full).</p><p><a href="http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20080720/opinion/807200318&amp;sfad=1"><b><i>read</i></b></a><b><i>the op-ed</i></b></p><p></p></span>
