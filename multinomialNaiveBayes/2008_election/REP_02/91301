front of other pows, in terms of bucking his party if that's what it takes to do what he thinks is right for the country, on a whole variety of issues. but the question really remains, when has (candidate full) stood up and taken on his party on anything of national significance? and on the issue of immigration, when (candidate full) was leading that issue, taking great risk and taking a pounding from his own party, (candidate full) was not significantly engaged in that debate and the accounting of the votes ultimately, where he actually put amendments or tried to support amendments that would derail immigration reform in this country. another example of (candidate full)'s courageous leadership and (candidate full) not walking the walk."</p><p><b><i><a

reagan library and the lbj library, in texas, they'd like to have a series of town halls using both libraries in a kind of bipartisan fashion. you think that would advance the interest of the country during this campaign year?"</p><p><b>governor arnold schwarzenegger:</b> "i think so. i mean, i think it will be interesting to have a debate between the two candidates and to have town hall meetings together, so that people can hear from both of them without having those formal kind of question and answer sessions where they stand behind a podium. i think those are fake. i don't buy in on what they say when they do those kind of formats. i think a town hall meeting would be much better.</p><p>"and i think that it will be also very important for them to talk about reaching across the aisle, and i think this is a very attractive part about senator (candidate last) because he doesn't just talk about that, he has proven it over and over again that he can reach across aisle. he can bring people on board and create some action. and, i think that's what we need in the future. we need to have someone there that can bring both of the parties together because there's no way that we can reshape and fix our country the very different ills that we have and create again a better image overseas with just one party. you have to have both parties work together, and this is why i'm a believer in the post partisanship. it has worked in our state and is a whole new way of looking at it: to be willing to compromise, and to be a public servant and not party servant."</p><p><b><i><a

senator (candidate last) made a commitment that he would abide by public financing. he's now changed his mind. i understand it's too his advantage and certainly everybody understands that, but there are consequences to that, and i think senator (candidate last) is right to point out when his opponent says one thing and does another. and i'm sure we'll hear a lot more about that, especially on specific policies, whether it's tax policies or second amendment policies. i think part of a general election debate is a compare and contrast, but the nice thing is, i think that you are going to see a real disagreement on the issues. this isn't going to be a fight on personalities or just name calling or mudslinging. you've got two honorable people who've served their country, who are intelligent, patriotic , but have very different views of how do we fight the war against terrorism."</p><p><b><i><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abpgssq9h8u">watch</a> gov. bobby

i hope he changes his position because if we had done what senator (candidate last) asked us to do for the last couple of years, today iran and al-qaeda would be in control of iraq. it would be a terrible defeat for us and our allies in the middle east and throughout the world. instead, we've got a country that's defending itself, that's growing economically, where there's been genuine
