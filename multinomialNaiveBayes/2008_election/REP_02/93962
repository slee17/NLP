<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- (candidate last)-palin 2008 announced today that a majority of the board members of the united states hispanic chamber of commerce have endorsed (candidate full) for president because of his unwavering support for small business. hispanics are the largest minority business community, owning 6.6 percent of all american businesses. <p>"i am supporting (candidate full) because he understands that small businesses are the job engine of america, and he has a real plan for the issues that hispanic-owned small businesses confront, such as health care," said jerry natividad of colorado. "(candidate full)'s plan puts families first, provides them with more choices, and while it cuts costs for my business, it allows my company to afford the best medical coverage for my employees. (candidate full)'s plan will not solve the problem of the uninsured and will make health care a government-run plan that will put a bigger burden on american taxpayers." </p><p>maria g. taxman of missouri added: "i am very confident (candidate full) will continue to break down foreign trade barriers, giving hispanic-american-owned small businesses the opportunity to compete in the global markets. (candidate full) will promote a strong and growing economy that creates news jobs and increases wages. on the other hand, (candidate full) proposes billions in higher taxes, more spending and isolationism from global economy." <b><u> </u></b></p><p>members of ushcc endorsing (candidate full):  </p><p>eric carson -- hawaii<br/>elizabeth gallagher -- nevada<br/>jerry natividad -- colorado<br/>jeanette hernandez prenger -- missouri <br/>nina vaca -- texas<br/>massey villarreal -- texas<br/>maria taxman -- missouri<br/>juventino cano -- illinois<br/>david gomez -- illinois<br/>steve gutierrez -- michigan<br/>alfredo rodriguez new jersey<br/>david hernandez -- florida<br/>ignacio veloz -- puerto rico</p></span>
