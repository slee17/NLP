<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, u.s. senator (candidate full) issued the following statement on the "stop iran" rally: <p>"throughout my political career, i have sought to rise above partisanship on critical national issues. nowhere is this more true than on important matters of national security. earlier this year, senator (candidate last), senator (candidate last) and i issued a joint statement on the genocide in darfur and pledged to support efforts to bring it to an end. earlier this month, senator (candidate last) and i put the campaign aside to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on our country and talk about the importance of national service. </p><p>"next monday, the day before iranian president ahmadinejad is to speak before the united nations general assembly, several organizations will sponsor an event to draw attention to the importance of halting iran's efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. governor palin and i share a strong belief that a nuclear armed iran poses a grave threat to the security of americans and to our allies. iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. the risk that iran would provide terrorists with a nuclear weapon is too great for the world to ignore. iranian president ahmadinejad has denied the holocaust occurred and called israel a 'stinking corpse.' a nuclear-armed iran would destabilize the entire region. preventing iran from acquiring nuclear weapons should be a shared goal of every american, not another occasion for partisan posturing. </p><p>"governor palin was pleased to accept an invitation to address this rally and show her resolve on this grave national security issue, regrettably that invitation has since been withdrawn under pressure from (PARTY NAME) partisans. we stand shoulder to shoulder with (PARTY NAME)s, (PARTY NAME) and independents alike to oppose ahmadinejad's goal of a nuclear armed iran. senator (candidate last)'s campaign had the opportunity to join us. senator (candidate last) chose politics rather than the national interest."</p></span>
