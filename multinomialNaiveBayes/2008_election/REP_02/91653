"for the (candidate last) (PARTY NAME), a tax cut is no longer letting you keep more of what you earn. in their lexicon, a tax cut includes tens of billions of dollars in government handouts that are disguised by the phrase 'tax credit.'"

"the 'tax-cut plan' of (PARTY NAME) presidential nominee (candidate full) is anything but. in fact, it's nothing more than another liberaled-up wealth-transference program that, in the 'old days,' was known as welfare. ... just as troubling, however, is this little factoid: even the one-third of all american working families who pay no income taxes now will receive a government check under the (candidate last) plan. and that number could rise to about 44 percent under (candidate last)'s proposal."

"in truth, as <i>the wall street journal</i> detailed yesterday, nearly all of those 'cuts' actually come in the form of 'refundable tax credits,' by which the government in effect writes a check to those who meet certain criteria - even if they don't pay taxes in the first place. in other words, (candidate last)'s 'tax cuts' really amount to a sizable expansion of welfare. that leaves american taxpayers to foot the bill - both directly, and through the lost economic opportunity that's sure to follow (candidate last)'s promised tax hikes on income, dividends and capital gains."

"(candidate last)'s transformation, if you go by his campaign so far, would mean higher income taxes, higher social security taxes, higher investment taxes, higher corporate taxes, massive new domestic spending, and a healthcare plan that perhaps could be the next step to a full-scale, single-payer system. is that what most americans want, someone who will fulfill a (PARTY NAME) policy wish list?"

"even though senator (candidate last)'s plan eliminates individual income taxes for seniors with incomes less than $50,000, his plan would raise taxes for almost 10 million senior households, over a third of the total (not shown in table). on average, seniors would face a tax increase of about 2 percent of income."

"most debate over whether to extend the reduced rates on dividends and capital gains has focused on the tax benefits of these cuts to high-income taxpayers. what has been largely ignored is the impact these tax policies have on corporations' decisions on how best to distribute their income to shareholders--including senior citizens, who rely most on the stable flow of income that dividends provide. a recent tax foundation analysis illustrated that a large number of those benefiting from dividends are seniors and those on the verge of retirement (see <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/1236.html"><u> www.taxfoundation.org</u> </a>). a further analysis of these seniors earning dividends reveals that lower-income seniors who file tax returns depend more heavily on dividend income than high-income seniors."

"changes in the individual income tax affect most businesses in the united states. that is because taxes on business earnings are often paid through the individual income tax when 'passed-through' to business owners. the business income from sole proprietorships, farm proprietorships, partnerships, s corporations, etc., is all taxed at the owners' individual income tax rates. this year 34 million business owners are expected to receive this type of income and pay tax on this income through the individual income tax. these businesses are typically small and often entrepreneurial in nature, and a source of innovation and risk-taking in the economy. moreover, these business owners are frequently subject to the highest individual income tax rates."
