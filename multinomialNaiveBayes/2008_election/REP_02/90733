<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full) today issued the following statement: <p>"congressman john lewis' comments represent a character attack against governor sarah palin and me that is shocking and beyond the pale. the notion that legitimate criticism of senator (candidate last)'s record and positions could be compared to governor george wallace, his segregationist policies and the violence he provoked is unacceptable and has no place in this campaign. i am saddened that john lewis, a man i've always admired, would make such a brazen and baseless attack on my character and the character of the thousands of hardworking americans who come to our events to cheer for the kind of reform that will put america on the right track. </p><p>"i call on senator (candidate last) to immediately and personally repudiate these outrageous and divisive comments that are so clearly designed to shut down debate 24 days before the election. our country must return to the important debate about the path forward for america."</p></span>
