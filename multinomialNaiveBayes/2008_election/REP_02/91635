"in times of hardship and distress, we should be more vigilant than ever in holding corporate abuses to account, as in the case of the housing market. americans are right to be offended when the extravagant salaries and severance deals of ceo's -- in some cases, the very same ceo's who helped to bring on these market troubles -- bear no relation to the success of the company or the wishes of shareholders. something is seriously wrong when the american people are left to bear the consequences of reckless corporate conduct, while the offenders themselves are packed off with another forty - or fifty million for the road. if i am elected president, i intend to see that wrongdoing of this kind is called to account by federal prosecutors. and under my reforms, all aspects of a ceo's pay, including any sever ance arrangements, must be approved by shareholders."

(candidate full) believes that where we find abuses, they need to be swiftly punished. to make sure it never happens again, we must reform the laws and regulations governing the oil futures market, so that they are just as clear and effective as the rules applied to stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments."

(cnn's "situation room," 6/26/08) <b> </b></p><p>harvard professor and former council of economic advisors chairman martin feldstein: "increasing the expected future supply of oil would also reduce today's price." "any policy that causes the expected future oil price to fall can cause the current price to fall, or to rise less than it would otherwise do. in other words, it is possible to bring down today's price of oil with policies that will have their physical impact on oil demand or supply only in the future. for example, increases in government subsidies to develop technology that will make future cars more efficient, or tighter standards that gradually improve the gas mileage of the stock of cars, would lower the future demand for oil and therefore the price of oil today. similarly, increasing the expected future supply of oil would also reduce today's price. that fall in the current price would induce an immediate rise in oil consumption that would be matched by an increase in supply from the opec producers and others with some current excess capacity or available inventories. any steps that can be taken now to increase the future supply of oil, or reduce the future demand for oil in the u.s. or elsewhere, can therefore lead both to lower prices and increased consumption today."

"we need longer term plans to solve the longer term energy problems of united states. in case you aren't familiar with how markets react, a coherent, logical plan of action towards providing long term solutions will have a positive impact now on the price of energy. why? because it will shift the short term psychology of the market away from doom and gloom towards a light at the end of the tunnel scenario. we only need to look at president bush's lifting of the moratorium on off-shore drilling to see an example of this in the markets. did this act significantly change the short term outlook for oil? no, but it changed the discussion on the subject at a time when it was needed. in turn, this aided the shift in market psychology back to some fundamentals like demand.....which is dro pping."
