(candidate full), r-ariz., and the bush administration, is more closely tailored to the needs of today's volunteer military. veterans leaving active service would see their monthly education benefits rise to $1,500, enough to cover the average public university. to boost retention, this plan would allow members who served six years or more to transfer part or all their post-service education benefits to a spouse or child. there's no official cost estimate for this alternative, but government analysts had calculated that such a program would run $1 billion to $2 billion a year. </p><p>that's a more reasonable price tag, but given the nation's $400 billion annual deficit, it, too, needs to be paid for. in this case, the first place to look is the pentagon's own bloated weapons procurement programs, such as the navy's new coastal combat ship, which are riddled with cost overruns. </p><p>war veterans such as chris house have made great sacrifices to serve their country, and they deserve more help to further their education and get on with their lives. now it's time to ask taxpayers or defense contractors to sacrifice a little so that can happen. </p><p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080513/edit13.art.htm"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the editorial in the usa today</p></span>
