<span class="displaytext"><b>arlington, va -- </b>today, u.s. representative eric cantor (r-va) held a press conference call to discuss (candidate full)'s iraq position in light of recent comments from his national co-chair claire mccaskill: <p><b>representative eric cantor: </b>"my concern has to do with (candidate full)'s national co-chair claire mccaskill's statements on the news shows this week, responding to a question about whether (candidate full) was going to be changing his iraq policy. and claire mccaskill responded emphatically, no, that he would not change course. i just believe that that raises serious questions as to the sensibility of that position given what's going on in iraq right now, what's going on, on the ground. </p><p>"and i think that if you look at (candidate full)'s plan, what sounded sensible, perhaps to some, a year ago when he came out with a plan of one brigade a month, and it would take sixteen months, and we would automatically go into withdrawal. now i believe, given the facts on the ground and the progress that has been made over the last year, i believe its disingenuous to the american people. and again it ignores the realities on the ground. </p><p>"i don't think there's any question that (candidate full) should change his plan in iraq. his old plan is the wrong way to go. i think that it's clear from <i>the</i> <i>washington post</i> editorial board to pretty much, i don't want to say unanimous, but an overwhelming number of pundits saying that his plan of withdrawal is the wrong way to go, given the progress on the ground. i think he'll have to change it. </p><p>"the fact that claire mccaskill demonstrated [(candidate full)'s] unwillingness to change direction is sort of ironic in that the direction in her statement is ironic, that given the facts on the ground, the fact that he accuses current administration policy of not reacting to realities. the fact that he is now clinging to a very ideological commitment on his part, and frankly, commitment to some left-wing supporters that he won't change his mind. i find that interesting. </p><p>"but at the end of the day, we're talking about the country's national interests. we're talking about security. that's the purpose of this call to raise some of these questions as to why barrack (candidate last) would want to sacrifice the progress that has been made."... </p><p><b>(candidate last) spokesman brian rogers: </b>"i guess the question is, if indeed he's going to go to iraq and nothing that he sees will change or impact his decision-making on this, then why is he going? if it's just to check a box politically, then it represents the kind of cynical politics that the american people are pretty sick and tired off." </p><p>• <b>listen to the full conference call here: </b><a href="http://blip.tv/file/1044474"><b>http://blip.tv/file/1044474</b></a><b> </b></p><p><b><u>yesterday, (candidate last) national co-chair senator claire mccaskill said "no" (candidate last) "will not" change iraq plan to reflect the reality on the ground, no matter the consequences</u></b> </p><p><b>yesterday, (candidate last) national co-chair senator claire mccaskill says "no" (candidate full) will not change his position on iraq even if that means sacrificing the progress being made.</b> msnbc's monica novotny: "in this week's new yorker, george packer writes about (candidate last)'s original withdrawal plan in the context of what we're now seeing as a relative stabilization in parts of iraq. he writes about (candidate last), 'he doubtless realizes that his original plan, if implemented now, could revive the badly wounded al qaeda in iraq, reenergize the sunni insurgency, embolden moqtada al-sadr to recoup his militia's recent losses to the iraqi army, and return the central government to a state of collapse. the question is whether (candidate last) will publicly change course before november.' will he?" senator claire mccaskill: "no. he will not. senator (candidate last) fundamentally disagrees with that assessment."
