<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, (candidate full) will sit down with abc news for an interview to be aired on abc's "world news tonight." please find below a reminder that while (candidate full) was trying to score political points in the (PARTY NAME) primaries by calling the surge a failure, abc news was reporting the progress being made in iraq because of the surge: <p><b><u>just this week, (candidate full) told abc that even with the success of the surge, he would not have supported it:</u></b> </p><p><b>(candidate last) told abc's terry moran that, despite the progress that has occurred in iraq, he would not have supported the surge.</b> moran: "'[t]he surge of u.s. troops, combined with ordinary iraqis' rejection of both al qaeda and shiite extremists have transformed the country. attacks are down more than 80% nationwide. u.s. combat casualties have plummeted, five this month so far, compared with 78 last july, and baghdad has a pulse again.' if you had to do it over again, knowing what you know now, would you -- would you support the surge?" (candidate last): "no, because -- keep in mind that --" moran: "you wouldn't?" (candidate last): "well, no, keep -- these kinds of hypotheticals are very difficult. hindsight is 20/20. i think what i am absolutely convinced of is that at that time, we had to change the political debate, because the view of the bush administration at that time was one that i just disagreed with." moran: "and so, when pressed, (candidate full) say s he still would have opposed the surge."
