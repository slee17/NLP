stop sending $700 billion to countries that oppose american values and finance our enemies; and drill for oil and natural gas. we must strengthen incentives for all energy alternatives -- nuclear, clean coal, wind, solar and tide. we will encourage the manufacture of hybrid, flex fuel and electric automobiles. we will lower the cost of energy, and create millions of new jobs. </p><p>i will not impose "one size fits all" health care on families and small businesses through expensive mandates and fines. i will bring down the skyrocketing cost of health care with competition and choice, reform the insurance market to be fair, and allow you to keep the same health plan if you change jobs or choose to stay home. </p><p>one in five jobs in the u.s. depends on trade and i will fight the threat to those jobs from (PARTY NAME) plans for isolationism. i won't make it harder to sell our goods overseas and kill more jobs. i will open new markets to goods made in america and make sure our trade is free and fair. and i'll make sure we help workers who've lost a job that won't come back find a new one that won't go away. </p><p>senator (candidate last) wants to raise taxes and restrict trade. the last time america did that in a bad economy it led to the great depression. </p><p>while most americans are rightly concerned with the economic crisis, a world of pressing national security challenges also awaits the next president. </p><p>the gains our troops have made in the past 18 months in iraq could be lost if we pull our troops out prematurely and regardless of the conditions on the ground. we have also dealt devastating blows to al qaeda, especially in iraq, but terrorists have found sanctuary on the pakistan frontier among those trying to topple governments in both kabul and islamabad. </p><p>afghanistan is reaching a crisis point, just as iraq did in 2006. as an early supporter of the surge strategy in iraq, i know that turning around this situation will require more than just increased troop levels. we also need a new, comprehensive strategy, one that integrates civil and military efforts and engages with various afghan tribes. </p><p>other major threats loom on the horizon: the iranian and north korean nuclear programs; aggressive russian behavior toward its neighbors; venezuelan adventurism; genocide in darfur; and global warming. and those are only the dangers that we know of. just as few expected the russians to invade georgia, we remain unaware of precisely where our next crisis will erupt, or when. the only certainty is that, as (candidate full) guaranteed, the tests facing the next president will be more severe if he is seen as weak in national security leadership. </p><p>i have devoted my life to safeguarding america. former secretary of state george shultz compares diplomacy to tending a garden -- if you want to see relationships flourish, you have to tend them. i have done that, by traveling the world and establishing ties with everyone from dissidents to heads of state. there is great need for american leadership in the world, and i understand that only by exercising that leadership with grace and wisdom can we be successful in safeguarding our interests. </p><p>when i am president, i will not offer up unconditional summit meetings with dangerous dictators, nor will i foreclose diplomatic tools that serve our interests. i will respect our trade agreements with our allies, not unilaterally renounce them. i will close the guantanamo bay prison and ban torture. i will expand our armed forces and transform our civil and military agencies to win the struggle against violent islamic extremism. </p><p>i believe that america is an exceptional country, one that demands exceptional leadership. after the difficulties of the last eight years, americans are hungry for change and they deserve it. my career has been dedicated to the security and prosperity of america and that of every nation that seeks to live in freedom. it's time to get our country, and our world, back on track. </p><p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/sb122567508079392051.html?mod=todays_us_opinion"><b><i>read</i></b></a><b><i>the op-ed</i></b></p></span>
