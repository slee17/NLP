(PARTY NAME) politicians, and the news media, should get this story right. it's always easy to take a picture of a shuttered plant gate and interview a frustrated 55-year-old who worked there all his life. it's harder to find the 25-year-old who has a job making - and exporting - solar panels; or the parents who can afford a cheaper bike or sweater for their children because those items were made in china. </p><p>so far, on the trade issue, (candidate last) is living up to his "straight talk" reputation, while the (PARTY NAME) are twisting the truth. <b><i></i></b></p><p><a href="http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=19369849&amp;brd=1817&amp;pag=461&amp;dept_id=68562&amp;rfi=6"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a><b><i>the full column by cokie roberts and steve roberts: "(candidate last) tells truth about trade" </i></b></p></span>
