(candidate full) has said it once, he's said it again, if he becomes president, he will make sure that osama bin laden is either executed in the courtroom or killed on the battlefield, period. here we have (candidate full) trying to apologize, trying to say that we ought not make him a martyr. frankly, i believe the definition of a martyr is someone who dies for his cause or is killed for his cause. so really, what we are hearing, as you suggest, is that (candidate full) says that osama bin laden should not be subjected to death in the dea th penalty. that is not where most americans are, and obviously it demonstrates again the world view that (candidate full) would approach the awesome task of being commander in chief, not something that the american people would really approve of." </p><p><a href="https://mymail.(candidate last)08hq.com/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzhidxd9vgo">watch</a> rep. eric cantor</p></span>
