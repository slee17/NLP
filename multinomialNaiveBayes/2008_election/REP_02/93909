<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full)'s presidential campaign today launched the coalition to protect coal jobs. the coalition, a nationwide group including members of congress, state government and other influential leaders, will spread the message about the importance of clean coal technology and the advantages of tapping the country's vast coal reserves. the group will also speak out to protect critical coal jobs when they come under attack from the most anti-american energy ticket in history. <p>in addition to providing domestic energy, the coal industry is a critical part of the economy in several states. as part of (candidate full)'s "all of the above" energy plan, the lexington project, clean coal will be a key component of the drive to energy independence. </p><p>(candidate full)'s support for clean coal technology is in sharp contrast with both (candidate full) and his running mate, (candidate full). earlier this year (candidate full) said, "what we ought to tax is dirty energy, like coal" and just last week, (candidate full) claimed to be a "hard-coal miner" on his trip to virginia, saying that it was "nice to be back in coal country." yet a few days earlier in ohio, senator (candidate last) said he wants "no coal plants here in america" and that he and (candidate full) are "not supporting clean coal." </p><p><b>congresswoman shelley moore capito:</b> "with senator (candidate full)'s comments in maumee, ohio, it is clear that coal is under attack by the liberal leadership in washington. the future of west virginia and its vital resource are at stake in this election. west virginians know that you cannot talk one way on the campaign trail and act differently in washington. senator (candidate last)'s comments are an attack on west virginia's future and good paying jobs in the state. they reveal the real agenda of some in washington to ban the use of coal in america which would be devastating to west virginia's economy. now that the real (candidate last)-(candidate last) plan to tax and then ban the use of coal has been revealed, it is not surprising that they have not made any campaign stops in west virginia." </p><p><b>former virginia governor and senator george allen:</b> "when senator (candidate last) said, 'we're not supporting clean coal ... no coal plants here in america,' he reminded us of the (candidate last) campaign's absurd, pandering opposition to clean coal technology, which is important to our economic and energy security. virginia can't afford a president that has proposed taxing coal, voted against coal-to-liquid legislation, and has energy proposals that would restrict the growth of virginia's coal industry, from our coalfields to the ports. indeed, abundant american clean coal is, and must be, an essential component of america's strategic energy independence for affordable electricity and a potential transportation fuel." </p><p><b>former u.s. congressman scott mcinnis:</b> "senator (candidate last)'s recent statement further demonstrates he's clueless to the western way of life and culture. thousands of men and women depend on jobs in the coal mines that are in my congressional district in the western slope. reports have concluded that the united states has enough supply in coal deposits to last 300-plus years, a keystone to america's energy independence when clean coal technology ensures coal mining a viable energy solution. instead of focusing on improving the technology to make the exploration and excavation a safer and cleaner process, (candidate last) has unequivocally opposed clean coal technology to appease those who are against senator (candidate last)'s 'all of the above' energy solution. his remark shows he and bara ck (candidate last) are complete strangers to colorado and the west. this is one more example of the (candidate last) campaign saying one thing on the coasts and something else in colorado." </p><p><b>rnc chairman robert m. "mike" duncan and jo ann davidson, former speaker of the ohio house of representatives and (PARTY NAME) national committee co-chair:</b> "when it comes to clean coal technology, an (candidate last)-(candidate last) ticket lacks the judgment and leadership necessary to help our country move towards energy independence. clean coal technology is right for our nation's energy needs and right for our nation's economy. while the (candidate last)-palin ticket understands the importance of energy independence for america, it is unfortunate that in every instance the (candidate last)-(candidate last) ticket can only offer 'no' when it comes to america's energy needs." </p><p><b>montana state senator roy brown:</b> "just days before describing himself as a 'hard-coal miner' to a group of united mine workers, (candidate full) spoke out against coal in ohio and pledged that there would be no new coal plants in the united states. worse than the (candidate last)-(candidate last) position against montana coal is the shameless pandering on the campaign trail that supports coal, but if elected, reassures strong opposition. while energy prices soar, the (candidate last)-(candidate last) campaign says no to tapping into proven american energy and instead is proposing higher taxes on oil, coal, and natural gas. montana voters deserve an honest energy policy -- something they're not getting from (candidate full) and (candidate full)." </p><p><b><i>listen to today's conference call with national members of the coalition to protect coal jobs: <a href="http://blip.tv/file/1287903">http://blip.tv/file/1287903</a></i></b> </p><p><b><u>national members of the coalition to protect coal jobs:</u></b> </p><p></p><ul> <li>governor bill owens (r-co)</li> <li>former representative scott mcinnis (r-co)</li> <li>rnc chairman robert m.
