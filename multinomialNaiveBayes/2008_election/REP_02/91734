<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, in israel, (candidate full) once again demonstrated that his words really don't matter. when asked about his support for meeting with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad "without precondition," (candidate full) said, "i think what i said" was that he would meet with these leaders "at my time and choosing" and with "preparation." unfortunately, for (candidate full), that is not what he said and campaigned on for months: <p><b><u>(candidate full): "what i said" was...</u></b> </p><p><b>today, (candidate full) claimed he said last year that he would meet with leaders "at my time and choosing" with "preparation."</b> questioner: "a year ago in south carolina you said you would meet, in your first year as president, with president ahmadinejad without preconditions. is there anything you have heard today here in discussions with israeli leaders that has made you rethink that pledge or are you still standing by that?" (candidate last): "dan, i think you have to take a look at what the question was in south carolina and how i responded. the question is would i meet with leaders without preconditions in pursuit ... but i think what i said in response was that i would, at my time and choosing, be willing to meet with any leader if i thought it would promote the national security interests of the united states of america. , and that continues to be my position, that if i think that i can get a deal that is going to advance o ur cause, then i would consider that opportunity. but what i also said was that there is a difference between meeting without preconditions and meeting without preparation."

(candidate last): "i would. and the reason is this, that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them -- which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration - is ridiculous."

(candidate last): "yeah, nothing's changed with respect to my belief that strong countries and strong presidents talk to their enemies and talk to their adversaries. i find many of president ahmadinejad's statements odious and i've said that repeatedly. and i think that we have to recognize that there are a lot of rogue nations in the world that don't have american interests at heart. but what i also believe is that, as john f. kennedy said, we should never negotiate out of fear but we should never fear to negotiate."

(candidate last) would offer the iranian regime a choice. if iran abandons its nuclear program and support for terrorism, we will offer incentives like membership in the world trade organization, economic investments, and a move toward normal diplomatic relations. if iran continues its troubling behavior, we will step up our economic pressure and political isolation. seeking this kind of comprehensive settlement with iran is our best way to make progress."
