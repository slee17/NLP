(candidate last): "well, charlie, i confess i obviously haven't listened to the briefs and looked at all the evidence. as a general principle, i believe that the constitution confers an individual right to bear arms. but just because you have an individual right does not mean that the state or local government can't constrain the exercise of that right, and, you know, in the same way that we have a right to private property but local governments can establish zoning ordinances that determine how you can use i t. and i think that it is going to be important for us to reconcile what are two realities in this country. there's the reality of gun ownership and the tradition of gun ownership that's passed on from generation to generation. you know, when you listen to people who have hunted, and they talk about the fact that they went hunting with their fathers or their mothers, then that is something that is deeply important to them and, culturally, they care about deeply. but you also have the reality of what's happening here in philadelphia and what's happening in chicago."
