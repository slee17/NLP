(candidate last) isn't merely "running to the center." he's fleeing from many of his primary positions so markedly and so rapidly that he's embracing a sizable chunk of president bush's policy. who would have thought that a (PARTY NAME) would rehabilitate the much-maligned bush agenda? </p><p>take the surveillance of foreign terrorists. last october, while running with the (PARTY NAME) pack, the illinois senator vowed to "support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies" that assisted in such eavesdropping after 9/11. as recently as february, still running as the liberal favorite against (candidate full), he was one of 29 (PARTY NAME) who voted against allowing a bipartisan senate intelligence committee reform of surveillance rules even to come to the floor. </p><p>two weeks ago, however, the house passed a bill that is essentially the same as that senate version, and mr. (candidate last) now says he supports it. apparently legal immunity for the telcos is vital for u.s. national security, just as mr. bush has claimed. apparently, too, the legislation isn't an attempt by dick cheney to gut the constitution. perhaps it is dawning on mr. (candidate last) that, if he does become president, he'll be responsible for preventing any new terrorist attack. so now he's happy to throw the new york times under the bus. </p><p>next up for mr. (candidate last)'s political blessing will be mr. bush's iraq policy. only weeks ago, the (PARTY NAME) was calling for an immediate and rapid u.s. withdrawal. when general david petraeus first testified about the surge in september 2007, mr. (candidate last) was dismissive and skeptical. but with the surge having worked wonders in iraq, this week mr. (candidate last) went out of his way to defend general petraeus against moveon.org's attacks in 2007 that he was "general betray us." perhaps he had a late epiphany. </p><p>look for mr. (candidate last) to use his forthcoming visit to iraq as an excuse to drop those withdrawal plans faster than he can say jeremiah wright "was not the person that i met 20 years ago." the senator will learn -- as (candidate full) has been saying -- that withdrawal would squander the gains from the surge, set back iraqi political progress, and weaken america's strategic position against iran. our guess is that he'll spin this switcheroo as some kind of conditional commitment, saying he'll stay in iraq as long as iraqis are making progress on political reconciliation, and so on. as things improve in iraq, this would be mr. bush's policy too. </p><p>mr. (candidate last) has also made ostentatious leaps toward mr. bush on domestic issues. while he once bid for labor support by pledging a unilateral rewrite of nafta, the (PARTY NAME) now says he favors free trade as long as it works for "everybody." his economic aide, austan goolsbee, has been liberated from the five-month purdah he endured for telling canadians that mr. (candidate last)'s protectionism was merely campaign rhetoric. now that mr. (candidate last) is in a general election, he can't scare the business community too much. </p><p>back in the day, the first-term senator also voted against the supreme court nominations of john roberts and samuel alito. but last week he agreed with their majority opinion in the heller gun rights case, and with their dissent against the liberal majority's ruling to ban the death penalty for rape. mr. (candidate last) seems to appreciate that getting pegged as a cultural lefty is deadly for national (PARTY NAME) -- at least until november. </p><p>this week the great (PARTY NAME) hope even endorsed spending more money on faith-based charities. apparently, this core plank of mr. bush's "compassionate conservatism" is not the assault on church-state separation that the aclu and liberals have long claimed. and yesterday, mr. (candidate last)'s campaign unveiled an ad asserting his support for welfare reform that "slashed the rolls by 80 percent." never mind that mr. (candidate last) has declared multiple times that he opposed the landmark 1996 welfare reform. </p><p>* * * </p><p>all of which prompts a couple of thoughts. the first is that mr. (candidate last) doesn't seem to think american political sentiment has moved as far left as most of the media claim. another is that the next president, whether (PARTY NAME) or (PARTY NAME), is going to embrace much of mr. bush's foreign and antiterror policy whether he admits it or not. think eisenhower endorsing truman's cold war architecture. </p><p>most important is the matter of mr. (candidate last)'s political character -- and how honest he is being about what he truly believes. his voting record in the senate and in illinois, as well as his primary positions, would make him the most liberal presidential candidate since george mcgovern in 1972. but he clearly doesn't want voters to believe that in november. he's still the (candidate last) americans don't know. </p><p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_print/sb121495450490321133.html"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the wall street journal editorial</p></span>
