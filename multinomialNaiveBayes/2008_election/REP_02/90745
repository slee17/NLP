<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full) issued the following statement on the passing of eldad regev and ehud goldwasser:<p>"i wish to extend my deepest condolences to the families of eldad regev and ehud goldwasser. when i met the regev and goldwasser families in israel, i was moved by their profound love for their sons, who were kidnapped by hezbollah in the summer of 2006. now we know that eldad and ehud made the ultimate sacrifice for the country they served and loved. in spite of this tragic loss, israel and the united states will remain united in their struggle against terrorism. the continuing attacks on israel by hezbollah, hamas, and other terrorist groups supported by state sponsors of terror like syria and iran pose a severe threat to israel. our (PARTY NAME) ally is under siege, and these two deaths are just the latest in a long line of brave israelis who have been killed by vicious terrorists. though we mourn the loss of eldad regev and ehud goldwasser, we are reminded by this that we must never waver in our support for israel, and we continue to demand the re lease of gilad shalit, taken captive by hamas and held illegally since the summer of 2006."</p></span>
