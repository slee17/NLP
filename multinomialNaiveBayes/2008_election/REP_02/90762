<span class="displaytext"><b>arlington, va --</b>u.s. senator (candidate full) issued the following statement on today's medicare vote by the united states senate: <p>"doctors are the heart of our health care system, and it is essential that they receive the funding needed to ensure quality care for our seniors. i fully support that aspect of this bill. however, congressional leaders have once again decided to put partisan positioning over the well being of millions of our seniors. we should not hold our doctors and seniors hostage to political gamesmanship and political votes. while this bill does meet our obligation to provide proper reimbursements to medicare physicians, it also rolls back important reforms, increases drug premiums, and places 2.3 million seniors at risk of losing the private health care coverage of their choice."</p></span>
