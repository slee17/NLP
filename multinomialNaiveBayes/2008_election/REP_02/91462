(candidate full) has committed to changing the transportation sector in the united states with flex-fuel vehicles, with plug-in hybrids, with cars that drive cleaner. he has a tax credit for cars that have zero carbon emissions coming out of their tailpipe and some credits for those that are cleaner than cars currently being driven. and he's offered a battery prize, something (candidate full) dismissed as a gimmick, despite the fact that he uses the same policy. (candidate full) uses that policy for something central to the future of america: the ability to drive an all-electric or hybrid vehicle cheaply and off an electricity sector that will look different than it does today. </p><p>"he'll commit to using coal, our most abundant natural resource, burning it cleanly and sequestering the carbon. he's committed to building 45 new nuclear power plants in the united states between now and 2030, to provide a stable source of energy for not just those electric vehicles, but for small businesses and households that are going to face higher heating costs. and, over the long term, he's committed to an environmentally respectful policy of cap-and-trade, which will bring the united states into global leadership on the issue of global warming. </p><p>"so his policies are ones which recognize the real economic duress that people feel right now, take bold actions to address them right now and for the foreseeable future, relieve us forever of our reliance on imported oil. </p><p>"this stands in stark contrast to the path that has been chosen by (candidate full). (candidate full) has said no to additional oil exploration in the u.s. he has said no to additional natural gas exploration. he has said no more coal-fired power plants. he has said no to nuclear power plants. (candidate full) has a policy that means the united states will not have more energy as it tries to grow and it will simply have to live with higher prices. (candidate full) himself has said higher gasoline prices are fine; they just got there faster than he expected. he has said it would be fine to put new taxes on natural gas and on coal, raising those prices further. </p><p>"so there's a stark difference in the viewpoint of what is important for america and there's a stark difference in the nature of action. (candidate full) is committed to doing the hard things, reaching across the aisle at times when the nation needs action to take correction in its course. he has stood on the senate floor with russ feingold for campaign finance reform. he has mobilized the gang of 14 to have supreme court justices put on the court. he has stood with ted kennedy when it was important to address immigration. </p><p>"in contrast, (candidate full) is touring europe and, back home, his leadership, nancy pelosi and harry reid, are opposing any effort to expand exploration in the united states and trying to muddy the waters by bringing up a vote for additional liheap help. (candidate full) supports making sure that those who are suffering from high energy prices get the help they need in this heating season, but he also supports solving the problem itself. and that is the major difference between the two candidates today." </p><p><a href="http://blip.tv/file/1110352"><b><i>listen</i></b></a><b><i>to the full conference call</i></b></p></span>
