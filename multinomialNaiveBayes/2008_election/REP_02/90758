<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full) today issued the following statement on former president carter's plans to meet with hamas: <p>"it is a grave and dangerous mistake for an american leader to meet with a terrorist organization like hamas. engaged in a campaign that deliberately targets innocent israeli civilians, hamas is dedicated to the destruction of israel. president carter is wrong to meet with hamas, a terrorist group that has also killed innocent americans. </p><p>"the very idea that a former president of the united states and commander-in-chief would meet with a terrorist organization demands a clear stance from all presidential candidates. refusing to take a stand, as senator (candidate last) has done, is not the strong leadership we need today. if senator (candidate last) is not decisive enough to condemn former president carter, how can he be strong enough to deal with the threat they pose to america and to our allies?"</p></span>
