(candidate full) has found a fellow maverick to be his running mate -- one who can help bring the right kind of reform to washington. ms. palin, like mr. (candidate last), has a strong record of battling the status quo, restoring accountability and effectiveness to government, and working to secure energy independence, root out corruption and curb wasteful spending. </p><p>as the chief executive of the nation's largest state, ms. palin oversees some of the country's largest energy reserves. she came into office at a critical time in alaska politics, facing a system plagued by corruption. her response was to immediately begin cleaning it up. the results of her leadership today speak for themselves: ms. palin's approval ratings top 80% -- more than 60% higher than that of the (PARTY NAME) congress. </p><p>ms. palin has a tangible, impressive record of achievement and executive experience. she is head of the alaska national guard and the chairman of two multistate agencies that make energy decisions that affect all americans. while (candidate full) spent almost all of the past two years running for president, ms. palin has been running a state. </p><p>it's telling that sen. (candidate last) chose to give a negative, partisan speech at the (PARTY NAME) national convention in denver. he envisions a (PARTY NAME) monolith in washington that will solve all of our problems. </p><p>but ms. palin knows that real change doesn't come from rigid adherence to party lines. she has transformed her state's government from what she called a "good ol' boys network" to an accountable, successful system. like mr. (candidate last), ms. palin realizes that the problem isn't a (PARTY NAME) administration or a (PARTY NAME) congress. it's business as usual in washington. </p><p>ms. palin's experience in reforming alaskan government shows she's ready to lead on the national stage. she stood up to members of her own party who abused their power, risking her political career by protesting ethics violations. ms. palin went on to pass ethics reform. she has put the people's interests ahead of her own -- like mr. (candidate last). </p><p>a (candidate last)-palin administration will not tolerate pork-barrel spending. in washington, mr. (candidate last) spoke out against the "bridge to nowhere," a $400 million waste of the taxpayers' money that led to an island with a few dozen residents. in juneau, alaska, ms. palin made sure the bridge went nowhere, canceling the earmark. she wasn't afraid to use her veto pen, and mr. (candidate last) won't be either. </p><p>in a state where energy production is a top priority, ms. palin is an expert in the field. she has never shied away from challenging the influence of big oil companies, all the while fighting for the development of new energy resources. ms. palin worked with (PARTY NAME) and (PARTY NAME)s to institute a rebate that used the state's vast oil revenues to help offset the high costs of fuel and heating in the state. </p><p>ms. palin has been a leader in the fight for american energy independence. like mr. (candidate last), she understands that we need an "all of the above" solution to secure our energy future. her influence extended far beyond alaska as she recently pushed through a gas pipeline project that will bring new supplies and lower prices to the lower 48 states. </p><p>just last month, meanwhile, the (PARTY NAME) running congress went on vacation rather than vote to allow offshore drilling, which would reduce our dependence on foreign oil. </p><p>beyond ethics and energy, ms. palin shares mr. (candidate last)'s passion for conservation. mr. (candidate last) often speaks of his admiration for theodore roosevelt, a conservationist and sportsman who surely would have enjoyed ms. palin's company. she grew up hunting and fishing in alaska, and she understands the importance of responsible stewardship of our environment. </p><p>all women should be proud of mr. (candidate last)'s selection of ms. palin as his running mate, an historic moment that came the week of the 88th anniversary of women's earning the right to vote. sarah palin will break through the glass ceiling that, as she noted on her first day as the vice presidential nominee, has 18 million new cracks thanks to (candidate full). </p><p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_print/sb122031229774188795.html"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the op-ed</p></span>
