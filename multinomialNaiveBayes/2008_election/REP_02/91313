(candidate last)'s plan calls for higher taxes on families making more than $250,000 a year. abc news reports wurzelbacher wants to buy the business for roughly $250,000 but doesn't expect to make that much in income right away. in the meantime, he might be eligible for the (candidate last) smorgasbord of middle-class tax credits. ninety-five percent strikes again! </p><p>(candidate last)'s broader point is sound. many small-business owners pay taxes on their business income as individuals, and if they are successful and employing people, they will pay higher taxes under (candidate last). this would be a tax on job creation, at the worst possible time. </p><p>where (candidate last)'s 95 percent promise is fundamentally dishonest is in how it discounts the effect of his health-care plan.

(candidate last) is proposing a large new tax on employment. </p><p>(candidate last)'s health plan, in contrast, would amount to a $1.3 trillion tax cut, according to the tax policy center. (candidate last) would tax employer-provided health benefits for the first time, but offset that with a $5,000 tax credit per couple for all health-insurance purchases. independent analysts say most taxpayers would be better off. </p><p>(candidate last) rarely talks of his plan in these terms, and (candidate last) has taken after it as a tax hike in a series of devastatingly effective and misleading negative ads. the latest cbs/new york times poll says 51 percent of people think (candidate last) would raise taxes, compared with 46 percent who think (candidate last) will. this means (candidate last) is holding his own or winning the tax debate with his gop opponent, a necessary condition for a (PARTY NAME) to win the white house. </p><p>(candidate last) has other tax proposals, including a doubling of the dependent exemption that could mean more than $1,000 for a typical family. but they don't substitute for a big-ticket tax cut for the middle class that would have kept (candidate last) from outbidding him on the issue. for now, (candidate last) has his magic number and is sticking to it. </p><p><a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/10172008/postopinion/opedcolumnists/os_magic_number_133979.htm"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the op-ed <b></b></p></span>
