(candidate last)'s conversations with the iraqi leaders, confirmed to the washington times by his campaign aides, began just two weeks after he clinched the (PARTY NAME) presidential nomination in june and stirred controversy over the appropriateness of a white house candidate's contacts with foreign governments while the sitting president is conducting a war. </p><p>some of the specifics of the conversations remain the subject of dispute. iraqi leaders purported to the times that mr. (candidate last) urged baghdad to delay an agreement with mr. bush until next year when a new president will be in office - a charge the (PARTY NAME) campaign denies. </p><p>mr. (candidate last) spoke june 16 to foreign minister hoshyar zebari when he was in washington, according to both the iraqi embassy in washington and the (candidate last) campaign. both said the conversation was at mr. zebari's request and took place on the phone because mr. (candidate last) was traveling. </p><p>however, the two sides differ over what mr. (candidate last) said. </p><p>"in the conversation, the senator urged iraq to delay the [memorandum of understanding] between iraq and the united states until the new administration was in place," said samir sumaidaie, iraq's ambassador to the united states. </p><p>he said mr. zebari replied that any such agreement would not bind a new administration. "the new administration will have a free hand to opt out," he said the foreign minister told mr. (candidate last). </p><p>mr. sumaidaie did not participate in the call, he said, but stood next to mr. zebari during the conversation and was briefed by him immediately afterward. </p><p>the call was not recorded by either side, and mr. zebari did not respond to repeated telephone and e-mail messages requesting direct comment. </p><p>mr. (candidate last) has called for a phased u.s. withdrawal of all but a residual force from iraq over 16 months, a position the iraqi government appears to have embraced. </p><p>u.s. and iraqi officials have been struggling for months to finalize a deal that will allow u.s. troops to remain after dec. 31, when a u.n. mandate sanctioning the military presence expires. iraqi officials have said that the main impediment is agreement over a timeline for u.s. redeployment and immunity from iraqi prosecution for u.s. troops and civilians. </p><p>(candidate last) campaign spokeswoman wendy morigi said mr. (candidate last) does not object to a short-term status of forces agreement, or sofa. </p><p>mr. (candidate last) told mr. zebari in june that a sofa "should be completed before january and it must include immunity for u.s. troops," miss morigi wrote in an e-mail. </p><p>however, the (PARTY NAME) nominee said a broader strategic framework agreement governing a longer-term u.s. presence in iraq "should be vetted by congress," she wrote. </p><p>she said mr. (candidate last) said the same thing when he met in july with iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki and mr. zebari in baghdad. </p><p>a recent article in the new york post quoted mr. zebari as saying that mr. (candidate last) asked iraqi leaders in july to delay any agreement on a reduction of u.s. troops in iraq until the next u.s. president takes office. </p><p>miss morigi denied this. she said the request for senate vetting was bipartisan and noted that the first (candidate last)-zebari conversation took place 12 days after four other members of the senate foreign relations committee - including (PARTY NAME) sens. richard g. lugar of indiana and chuck hagel of nebraska - wrote to secretary of state condoleezza rice and defense secretary robert m. gates urging consultation over any agreements committing u.s. troops and civilian contractors to iraq "for an extended period of time." </p><p>when mr. (candidate last) spoke to mr. zebari, he was speaking in his capacity as a senator and a member of the senate foreign relations committee, miss morigi said. "it's obvious that others are trying to mischaracterize (candidate last)'s position, [but] on numerous occasions he has made it perfectly clear that the united states only has one president at a time and that the administration speaks with one voice." </p><p>sen. jack reed, a rhode island (PARTY NAME) who accompanied mr. (candidate last) in iraq along with mr. hagel, said they made "no suggestion of any type of delay" in any agreements. </p><p>a congressional aide who was also present and spoke on the condition of anonymity said the senators asked for a congressional role similar to that required by the iraqi constitution for iraq's parliament. </p><p>still, the fact that the illinois (PARTY NAME) on june 3 clinched enough delegates to be assured the (PARTY NAME) presidential nomination gives his comments special force - something that also applies to the (PARTY NAME) nominee, sen. (candidate full) of arizona, a key proponent of the surge of extra u.s. forces to iraq last year. </p><p>as a u.s. senator, mr. (candidate last) "has a foot in both camps," said ross k. baker, a professor of political science at rutgers university. "it's within the jurisdiction of his committee and something he's entitled to speak about. it doesn't raise a red flag for me." </p><p>white house spokesman gordon johndroe declined to comment on the matter. </p><p>leslie phillips, a press officer at the u.s. embassy in baghdad, also declined to comment even though an embassy note-taker was present during the senators' meeting in iraq. "the embassy's role is purely to facilitate the meetings," she said. </p><p>presidential nominees traditionally have not intervened personally in foreign-policy disputes, although campaign surrogates have done so. </p><p>historian robert dallek has documented meetings with south vietnamese diplomats in 1968 by (PARTY NAME) vice-presidential candidate spiro agnew and anna chennault, widow of gen. claire chennault, the commander of "flying tiger" forces in china during world war ii. </p><p>mr. dallek, author of "flawed giant: lyndon johnson and his times 1961-1973," obtained tapes of the conversations from bugs the johnson administration had placed in the south vietnamese embassy in washington. </p><p>negotiations to end the vietnam war were taking place in paris at the time between the johnson administration and the north and south vietnamese. </p><p>mr. agnew and mrs. chennault "signaled the south vietnamese that they would get a better deal with richard nixon as president instead of the (PARTY NAME)" hubert humphrey, mr. dallek said. </p><p>"johnson was furious and said that nixon was guilty of treason," mr. dallek said, but neither he nor mr. humphrey disclosed the matter before the election, which mr. nixon won. </p><p><a href="http://washingtontimes.com/news/2008/oct/10/(candidate last)-sought-to-sway-iraqis-on-bush-deal/"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the article</p></span>
