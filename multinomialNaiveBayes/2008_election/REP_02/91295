(candidate last) opposed the bill, saying at the time that it included billions in unnecessary tax breaks for the oil industry. </p><p>the (candidate last) campaign has said the illinois senator supported the legislation because it included huge investments in renewable energy. yet (PARTY NAME) long have characterized the 2005 energy bill as being written by cheney. one of them, (PARTY NAME) primary rival hillary rodham (candidate last), criticized (candidate last) earlier this year for backing the "dick cheney lobbyist energy bill." </p><p>with polls showing concern over gas prices a prime concern of americans, (candidate last) has been depicting energy as the nation's most pressing national security and economic issue. in that effort, he casts (candidate last) as more concerned about oil company profits and drilling than an overall energy strategy. </p><p>the (candidate last) campaign charged that (candidate last) wasn't being straight with voters and showed bad judgment. </p><p>"while americans are hurting, (candidate full) is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today," (candidate last) campaign spokesman tucker bounds said. </p><p>in stumping tuesday in this key battleground state, (candidate last) sought to link the troubled economy with (PARTY NAME) policies and offer his own energy plan in contrast. </p><p>(candidate last) has proposed a $1,000-per family energy rebate to be paid for by a tax on excessive energy-company profits. he called for ending u.s. reliance on oil from the middle east and venezuela over the next 10 years, a project he said would cost the u.s. $150 billion. </p><p>(candidate last) has also proposed borrowing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve, a conditional and limited resumption of offshore drilling, and a new emphasis on alternative energy sources and hybrid vehicles. </p><p>"our economy is in turmoil, i don't have to tell the people of youngstown," (candidate last) told a high-school gymnasium audience in this rust-belt city. "people here have known some hard knocks and hard times." </p><p>ohio is a bellwether state, having voted for the winning candidate in all 11 presidential elections since 1964, including handing bush a close re-election victory in 2004. </p><p>cheney, a former oilman, early in the bush administration helped draft an energy policy that (candidate last) asserted is biased in favor of tax breaks and favorable treatment for big oil. it was an attempt to capitalize on cheney's unpopularity. </p><p>"president bush, he had an energy policy. he turned to dick cheney and he said, 'cheney, go take care of this,'" (candidate last) said. "cheney met with renewable-energy folks once and oil and gas (executives) 40 times. (candidate last) has taken a page out of the cheney playbook." </p><p>it was (candidate last)'s second day on a tour featuring a stepped-up emphasis on energy and harsher criticism of (candidate last). </p><p>increasingly, with his appearances this week and with a new ad, (candidate last) has been seeking to tie (candidate last) to the oil and gas industry, even though (candidate last) has no direct ties to the industry, unlike bush and cheney, who both worked in the industry before their election. </p><p>a new (candidate last) ad says big oil filled (candidate last)'s campaign with $2 million in contributions and that he "wants to give them another $4 billion in tax breaks." </p><p>however, that consists mainly of potential revenue from a (candidate last) proposal to lower corporate taxes on all american businesses. </p><p>the (candidate last) campaign has also pointed out that the ad doesn't mention (candidate last) has taken some $400,000 from oil company executives. </p><p>"we have to end the age of oil. "(candidate last) said. "if we fail to act, there are severe indications for national security, our economy and our environment." </p><p>(candidate last) has had trouble connecting with white working-class voters, who are a major factor in ohio. (candidate last) won the state in its (PARTY NAME) primary earlier this year. gov. ted strickland, who had been a (candidate last) supporter, gave a rousing endorsement of (candidate last), calling him "bright, young, energized and compassionate." </p><p>(candidate last)'s focused on economic issues. he said that oil giant exxon-mobil "makes in 30 seconds what the typical ohio worker makes in a year." </p><p>"we need more jobs and economic development. why don't we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work? nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community," he said. </p><p>(candidate last) has proposed a $15-billion-a-year program to help promote clean-energy jobs. </p><p>in a question-and-answer session, (candidate last) was asked if he would support term limits for members of congress by a questioner who noted that many senators were elderly. </p><p>"that's kind of a tricky question. i've got colleagues in the senate who are doing absolutely outstanding work, and they're well into their 70s," (candidate last) said. he praised ailing sen. edward m. kennedy as one. </p><p>"i'm generally not in favor of term limits," he said. "nobody is term-limiting the lobbyists or the slick operators walking around the halls of congress. i believe in one form of term limits. they're called elections." </p><p><a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080805/d92c87g80.html"><b><i>read</i></b></a><b><i>the article</i></b></p></span>
