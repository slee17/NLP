<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, as (candidate full) prepared to travel to israel, he told cbs' katie couric that he had never backtracked on the status of jerusalem. please find below a statement from randy scheunemann, (candidate last) 2008 senior foreign policy adviser:<p>"(candidate full) claimed his position that jerusalem should remain the 'undivided capital' of israel and his subsequent backtracking 'was no shift in policy' but that he just 'phrased it poorly.' yet he had stated this policy position before, and presumably at least some of his 300 foreign policy advisers worked on drafting and vetting his speech to aipac. (candidate full)'s various positions and unconvincing explanations cannot give israelis or americans much comfort about his ability to understand and explain, much less lead, on complicated diplomatic issues."</p><p><b><u>today, as he prepared to travel to israel, (candidate full) claimed he had never backtracked on the status of jerusalem</u></b></p><p> <b>(candidate full): "there was no shift in policy or backtracking in policy" concerning the status of jerusalem.</b> cbs's katie couric: "you said not too long ago that jerusalem should remain undivided. and then you backtracked on that statement. does that play into the argument that some believe that someone more experienced would not have made that kind of mistake?" (candidate last): "well, if you look at what happened, there was no shift in policy or backtracking in policy. we just had phrased it poorly in the speech. that has happened and will happen to every politician. you're not always gonna hit your mark in terms of how you phrase your policies. but my policy hasn't changed, and it's been very consistent. it's the same policy that bill (candidate last) has put forward, and that says that jerusalem will be the capital of israel, that we shouldn't divide it by barbed wire, but that, ultimately that is a final status issue that has to be resolved between the p alestinians and the israelis."
