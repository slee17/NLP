<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full) today issued the following statement on the jobs report:<p>"americans across this country are hurting and today's job numbers are just the latest indication. from rising gas prices to home foreclosures, families are struggling to meet economic challenges that become greater every day. washington can no longer abdicate its responsibility to act. our focus must be clear: enact policies to create jobs today.</p><p>"to get our economy back on track, we must enact a jobs-first economic plan that supports job creation, provide immediate tax relief for families, enact a plan to help those facing foreclosure, lower health care costs, invest in innovation, move toward strategic energy independence and open more foreign markets to our goods. </p><p>"the american people cannot afford an economic agenda that will take our country in the wrong direction and cost jobs. at a time when our small businesses need support from washington, we cannot raise taxes, increase regulation and isolate ourselves from foreign markets. these are the same old siren songs that have failed the american people time and time again."</p></span>
