"in 2006, he pushed for stronger regulation of fannie mae and freddie mac -- while mr. (candidate last) was notably silent," the post wrote. </p><p>(candidate last) attacked (candidate last) for having a top financial advisor who supported a deregulation bill a few years ago. yet two top (candidate last) financial advisors, with whom he met on friday to help him form his response to the current troubles on wall street, supported the same bill, which was signed by president (candidate last). </p><p>also last week, (candidate last) released a spanish-language ad that portrayed (candidate last) as anti-immigrant and anti-hispanic and tried to link him to immigration policies that were not his own as well as some choice rush limbaugh quotes that appeared to insult mexicans. </p><p>anyone who has followed the immigration debate knows that (candidate last) is the most pro-immigration (PARTY NAME) on the national stage and that he is not in the least anti-hispanic. to pull quotes from rush limbaugh, who has completely different immigration views than (candidate last) and who opposed him on that issue for years (and still does) is completely disingenuous. the ad is so bad that even the new york times called it "misleading." </p><p>(candidate last)'s campaign also accused (candidate last) of lying when (candidate last)'s campaign ran an ad saying that (candidate last) supported sex education for kindergarteners. but the bill in question, which (candidate last) supported in the illinois state senate, did indeed change state law to allow sex education for kindergarteners. </p><p>(candidate last) has said that he won't attack (candidate full)'s motives, only his policies. but he has repeatedly attacked (candidate last)'s motives, suggesting that he has been bought off by oil companies and lobbyists. </p><p>(candidate last)'s greatest strength as a candidate, aside from his oratorical skill, has long been his apparent sincerity and decency. voters attracted to him think of him as that rarest of things: an honest politician. he has claimed himself that he would never engage in the sort of deceptive politicking that he says has tainted washington for so long. </p><p>yet here he is violating his own professed standards. this is not the (candidate full) so many voters in new hampshire and elsewhere thought they knew. but it is the real (candidate full). for despite his rhetoric, he is in fact campaigning so dishonestly that even the washington post and the new york times have called him on it. which means that he is in practice no different from those regular politicians against whom his entire campaign has been built. </p><p><a href="http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=(candidate last)+in+the+mud%3a+so+much+for+honesty&amp;articleid=25fbff30-e785-4106-af08-92f0bbe63968"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the editorial</p></span>
