(candidate full) evidently cared more about criticism back home than visiting wounded american soldiers in germany. </p><p>that's the explanation from a spokesman for the presumptive (PARTY NAME) party presidential nominee when asked why mr. (candidate last) canceled a planned visit to the landstuhl regional medical center during his tour of the middle east and europe. </p><p>the (candidate last) campaign couldn't keep its story straight. </p><p>the first explanation was that the junior senator from illinois had decided to cancel the visit because the campaign-funded trip might have been viewed as inappropriate. later, the campaign blamed the pentagon for classifying the visit as a campaign stop. </p><p>the department of defense disputed the original (candidate last) spin -- and then the backspin. </p><p>as a u.s. senator, (candidate last) most certainly could visit the wounded and brought office staff -- just not from his campaign. "(r)ather than go forward and potentially get caught up in what might have been considered a political controversy of some sort, what we decided was that we not make a visit and instead i would call some of the troops that were there," mr. (candidate last) told the new york times. </p><p>he still could have visited had he kept his big media fawners behind. presumably, that would have been too audacious for the self-proclaimed agent of change. </p><p><a href="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/archive/s_580035.html"><b><i>read</i></b></a><b><i>the editorial</i></b></p></span>
