(candidate last) has been tested as few men ever have, and he has never been found wanting. (candidate full) has no experience -- none. he may be the most unprepared major-party candidate ever. his own vice presidential pick says our enemies will test him quickly and severely. there is no good reason to take that chance. </p><p>those who believe (candidate last)'s claims that he will reduce 95 percent of americans' taxes, while he pays for near-universal health care, subsidizes clean energy, expands our military commitment in afghanistan, adds to mass transit and highway infrastructure, etc., etc., are living in a dream world. </p><p>fortunately, there seem to be fewer and fewer dreamers every day, as the polls tighten and people begin to really look at all the promises (candidate last) has made. </p><p>(candidate full) promises us only his hard work and integrity, his experience and true grit, and a solid faith and optimism in america. in our view, that makes him the clear choice for the independent, thoughtful people of new hampshire. </p><p><a href="http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=joseph+w.+mcquaid%3a+america%27s+choice+this+tuesday&amp;articleid=9ba17574-5d1e-45df-8ce4-2f9648f2ae73"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the editorial</p></span>
