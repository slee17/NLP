<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, dr. danny jazarevic, who served as the chief of trauma, critical care and vascular surgery at landstuhl, issued the following statement on (candidate full)'s canceled visit to ramstein and landstuhl:<p>"last week, senator (candidate last) skipped a visit with wounded u.s. troops at landstuhl regional medical center in germany because the pentagon would not allow campaign staff or media to accompany him into the hospital. i served as director of trauma surgery at that hospital for nearly four years and saw the effect that a visit from a celebrity like senator (candidate last) could have on morale. during that time, i do not recall a single member of congress canceling a visit with the troops despite being just a few hours away, but senator (candidate last) seems to have been more concerned with how the visit would affect him than how it would affect the soldiers recovering from wounds received in the service of their country."</p><p><b><i>dr. danny jazarevic served as the chief of trauma, critical care and vascular surgery at landstuhl regional medical center.</i></b> in 1984, dr. jazarevic joined the united states army and later the florida national guard. he has since served in honduras, africa, saudi arabia, bosnia, and iraq. from december 2002 through january 2006, dr. jazarevic was assigned to the u.s. army hospital in landstuhl, germany, where he served as chief of trauma, critical care and vascular surgery. during this period, he deployed to iraq numerous times, including with the 101st airborne division forward surgical team and as director of operations for the 44th u.s. army medical command. he is currently the chief trauma surgeon at a civilian medical center in florida, and also serves as a full colonel in the u.s. army reserve. dr. jazarevic has been awarded the bronze star medal.</p></span>
