<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, u.s. senator (candidate full) made the following statement on taiwan: <p>"i welcome reports indicating that the sale of defensive arms to taiwan -- a package that has been on hold for too long -- will now move forward. by notifying congress of its intent to provide weapons aimed at bolstering taiwan's self defense, the administration is taking a step in the right direction. i have long supported such sales in order to strengthen deterrence in the taiwan strait and to help preserve the peace. american interests in asia are well-served through faithful implementation of the taiwan relations act, and if i am fortunate enough to be elected president, i will continue the longstanding and close ties between our peoples. </p><p>"in that spirit, however, i note that the administration has refrained from providing all of the elements requested by taiwan for its legitimate security requirements. for example, the package will not include submarines or new f-16 aircraft. i urge the administration to reconsider this decision, in light of its previous commitment to provide submarines and america's previous sales of f-16s. these sales -- which could translate into tens of thousands of jobs here at home -- would help retain america's edge in the production of advanced weaponry and represent a positive sign in these difficult economic times. </p><p>"we should seek cooperative and productive relations with china that proceed in a spirit of confidence, and we should promote the improvement of cross-strait relations. as we do, however, we should understand that the possibility of productive ties between taiwan and china are enhanced, not diminished, when taipei speaks from a position of strength. i believe that america should continue to sell defensive weapons to taiwan in the future, in accordance with its security requirements, and stand by this remarkable free and (PARTY NAME) people."</p></span>
