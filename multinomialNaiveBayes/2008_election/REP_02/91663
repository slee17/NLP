<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, the (candidate last)-palin campaign launched the honest and open election hotline to help citizens learn the location of their polling place, as well as report any instances of irregularities at the polls, including voter fraud, intimidation, violence and electioneering. the hotline can be accessed via phone at: 866-976-vote. <p>"with november 4th quickly approaching, our honest and open election hotline will serve as an informative guide for all americans participating in the electoral process," said (candidate last)-palin national political director mike duhaime. "the hotline will allow us to learn about and take steps toward remedying any voter irregularities at polling places across the country. while we are hopeful that election day will be free of any wrongdoing, allies of the (PARTY NAME) party, such as acorn, have shown a willingness to commit fraud in both this election cycle and in 2004. given the tightness of the polls, all examples of fraud must be addressed to preserve the integrity of the election." </p><p>in 2004, multiple forms of voter fraud occurred, including voter intimidation, fraudulent registrations, multiple ballots cast and votes bought for money. already during the 2008 election cycle, a dead woman in missouri cast an absentee ballot, individuals were arrested for voting twice in florida and people in ohio registered and voted on the same day.</p></span>
