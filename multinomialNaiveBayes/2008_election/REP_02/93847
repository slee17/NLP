<span class="displaytext"><b>arlington, va--</b> in a conference call today, colonel bud day, usaf (ret.) said the following regarding wesley clark's attack on (candidate full)'s military service on cbs "face the nation": <p>"i, too, was quite astonished with this unworthy remark made by wesley clark against one of my great warriors. (candidate full) spent 65 months of continual combat against the north vietnamese. he did so on a voluntary basis because he had been involved in operations on a ship called the forrestal, which was involved in a terrible fire, and as a result of that experience john could have gone home after a fairly short period of time in combat. he learned that the oriskany needed additional pilots; he volunteered to go there and fly an ongoing tour. going 'downtown' to hanoi was absolutely the most dangerous enterprise anyone could be involved in, in 1967. it was the most heavily defended city in the world and no one who had been downtown, no one who had been in a vietnamese prison, no one who fought combat in vietnam will ever question (candidate full)'s warrior credentials. this backhanded slap against john of not being a worth y warrior because he just got shot down is one of the more surprising insults in my military history. (candidate full) was in my squadron for roughly two and a half years and i saw him in every aspect where the vietnamese tried to turn him around and get him to leave his comrades early. he instantly refused that because he knew that was the wrong thing to do. so again, i am astounded that a person who represents a presidential candidate would be involved in this kind of a political shenanigan against a man of (candidate full)'s character." </p><p><b><i>colonel bud day </i></b><i>is the most decorated american service member since general douglas macarthur, having received nearly 70 decorations and awards including more than 50 for combat. colonel day received the medal of honor, the nation's highest military decoration. like (candidate full), colonel day was shot down by the north vietnamese in 1967; colonel day shared a cell with senator (candidate last) in hanoi and spent 87 months as a prisoner of war. colonel day retired from active duty in 1977 after logging close to 8,000 flying hours. colonel day was born in sioux city, iowa, and currently resides in shalimar, florida.</i> </p><p><b><u>background:</u></b> </p><p><b>yesterday on cbs' "face the nation," wesley clark attacked (candidate full)'s military service.</b> clark: "but he hasn't held executive responsibility. that large squadron in the navy that he commanded? it wasn't a wartime squadron. he hasn't been there and ordered the bombs to fall. he hasn't seen what it's like when diplomats come in and say, 'i don't know whether we're going to be able to get this point through or not, do you want to take the risk, what about your reputation, how do we handle this publicly?' he hasn't made those points bob."
