<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, (candidate last)-palin 2008 campaign manager rick davis released the following statement in response to the united states supreme court regarding the case <i>ohio (PARTY NAME) party v. ohio secretary of state jennifer brunner</i>: <p>"today's decision by the united states supreme court does not address violations of the help america vote act (hava) by ohio secretary of state jennifer brunner. rather, the court ruled that congress had likely not authorized private individuals or political parties to bring suit under the section of hava requiring voter registration verification through data-matching. it remains our belief that american citizens should be guaranteed that their legitimate votes are not wiped away by illegally cast ballots. what is no longer in question is the partisan nature of jennifer brunner's efforts to minimize the level of fairness and transparency in this election."</p></span>
