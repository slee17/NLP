<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full) today issued the following statement on the jobs report: <p>"today's report of another 159,000 lost jobs confirms what america's working men and women have understood for months: our nation's economy is on the wrong track. it is imperative that congress act to address the financial crisis while protecting taxpayers and being good stewards of their dollars. but we must do more. </p><p>"america's middle class needs help from a government that is truly standing on their side and not in their way. i am committed to getting to the roots of this crisis -- reforming washington and cleaning up the mess created by the greed and crony capitalism of government-backed mortgage giants -- fannie mae and freddie mac. i will reverse out-of-control spending, end the wasteful and corrupting practice of earmarks, and get the government budget back to balance. i will reform health care to control costs and better serve american families, open markets around the globe for our products, cut taxes, and expand domestic production of energy to eliminate the ability of international oil markets to hold our economy hostage. i will create jobs and get the economy on the right track. </p><p>"unlike senator (candidate last), i do not believe we will create one single american job by increasing taxes, going on a massive spending binge, and closing off markets. our nation cannot afford senator (candidate last)'s higher taxes."</p></span>
