<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, (candidate last) 2008 senior foreign policy advisor randy scheunemann issued the following statement: <p>"the difference between (candidate full) and (candidate full) is that (candidate full) advocates an unconditional withdrawal that ignores the facts on the ground and the advice of our top military commanders. (candidate full) believes withdrawal must be based on conditions on the ground. prime minister maliki has repeatedly affirmed the same view, and did so again today. timing is not as important as whether we leave with victory and honor, which is of no apparent concern to (candidate full). the fundamental truth remains that senator (candidate last) was right about the surge and senator (candidate last) was wrong. we would not be in the position to discuss a responsible withdrawal today if senator (candidate last)'s views had prevailed."</p></span>
