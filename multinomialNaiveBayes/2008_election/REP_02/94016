<span class="displaytext"><b>arlington, va -- </b>u.s. senator (candidate full)'s presidential campaign issued the following statement from (candidate last) 2008 communications director jill hazelbaker in defense of (candidate full)'s energy positions: <p>"senator (candidate last)'s stance on offshore oil drilling has been mischaracterized. he has not changed his position. he has continually campaigned against additional drilling, calling the policy a 'gimmick' saying it was a 'scheme' and ridiculing those who support it. with his steadfast opposition to (candidate full)'s 'all of the above' approach to our energy crisis, americans should know that (candidate full) remains opposed to additional domestic oil drilling. speaker pelosi, moveon.org and the sierra club can take comfort from the fact that (candidate full) still opposes additional domestic oil drilling. meanwhile, the american people can be sure that (candidate full) will do what is necessary to reduce this country's dependence on middle east oil and bring down prices at the pump." </p><p><b><u>(candidate full) has not changed his position on offshore drilling</u></b> </p><p><b>(candidate full): </b>"this wasn't really a new position. what i'm saying is that we can't drill our way out of the problem."
