<span class="displaytext"><b>russert:</b> senator (candidate last), welcome back to meet the press.<p><b>(candidate last):</b> you didn't have to say unsuccessful; everybody knows that.</p><p><b>russert:</b> well, all part of the history. let's go right to it--iraq.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> mm-hmm.</p><p><b>russert:</b> we've been talking to voters across the country, our nbc/wall street journal poll: is victory in iraq still possible? thirty-six percent say victory's possible; 55 percent say victory not possible. and look at this, senator. was the war--was the war--was it a mistake to send troops? fifty- eight percent say yes, a mistake; 40 percent say no. are you surprised at those numbers?</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> not too. particularly on the issue of the second question, when we have experienced the enormous difficulties and sacrifice that have been part of this conflict that, certainly, you can understand that. americans are frustrated, and they're saddened our failures in this conflict. my point is, and i'm sure we'll get into it, and that is we have a chance of success, and i don't think that a lot of americans are as fully aware as they should be of the consequences of failure in iraq.</p><p><b>russert:</b> when you were speaking in 2005, the american enterprise institute, you said this...</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> mm-hmm.</p><p><b>russert:</b> "if we can't retain the support of the american people, we will have lost this war as soundly as if our forces were defeated on the battlefield." haven't they lost the support of the american people?</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> i think if we can show the american people some successes in iraq and continue and expand on some of the successes we've already experienced in anbar province and some neighborhoods in baghdad, that i think americans would--and if we do a better job, and that's people like me, of explaining the consequences of failure.</p><p>the consequences of failure, tim, are that there would be chaos in the region. there's three--two million sunni in baghdad. the iranians would continue to increase their influence, the saudis would have to help the sunni, the kurds would want independence, the turks will never stand for it. some people say partition. you'd have to partition bedrooms in baghdad because sunni and shia are, are married. this, this is a very, very difficult situation, but the consequences of failure, in my view, are unlike the vietnam war where we could leave and come home and it was over, that these people will try to follow us home and the region will erupt to a point where we may have to come back or we will be compating-- combating what is now, to a large degree, al-qaeda, although certainly other--many other factors of sectarian violence, in the region.</p><p><b>russert:</b> in hindsight, was it a good idea to go into iraq?</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> you know, in hindsight, if we had exploited the initial success, which was shock and awe, and we succeeded, and we had done the right things after that, all of us would be applauding what we did. we didn't. it was terribly mismanaged. it was--i went over there very shortly after the initial victory and came back convinced that we didn't have enough troops on the ground, we were making the wrong decisions, and that secretary rumsfeld was badly mismanaging the conflict. and i spoke about it and complained for years. so, if we had succeeded and done the right thing after the initial military success, then all of us would be very happy that one of the most terrible, cruel dictators in history was removed from power. now, because of our failures, obviously we have paid a very heavy price in american blood and treasure and a great sacrifice.</p><p><b>russert:</b> so it was a good idea to go in?</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> i think at the time, given the information we had. every intelligence agency in the world, not just u.s., believed that saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction. he had acquired and used them before. there was no doubt that he was going to acquire and use them if he could. the sanctions were breaking down. the oil for food scandal was in the billions of dollars. and, of course, at the time, given the information we had--hindsight is 20/20. if we'd have known we were going to experience the failures we experienced, obviously it would give us all pause. yet the information and the knowledge and the situation at the time, i think that it was certainly justified.</p><p><b>russert:</b> the pentagon's quarterly report, the director of the cia, the director of the defense intelligence agency, all have said that sectarian violence is the problem. in fact, the--general maples said that al-qaeda accounts for only a small fraction of the insurgent violence.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> you know the...</p><p><b>russert:</b> who's our enemy?</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> well, first of all, general petraeus, the general on the ground, does not agree with that. al-qaeda is exploiting these sectarian differences. they are trying to orchestrate attacks on both sunni and shia, but--in order to spark this and increase this sectarian violence that's going on. al-qaeda is playing significantly. now, are there problems with sectarian violence? of course there is. is there other problems, such as in anbar province where sunnis are now combatting al-qaeda? are al-qaeda being shoved out of baghdad into areas outside of baghdad? yes. and are there problems in those areas?</p><p>look, this is long and hard and difficult, and i've said it for a long time. and it's no last throes, it's no mission accomplished, it's no few dead-enders. it's long and hard and tough. we are experiencing some successes. do we have to experience more? yes. but to do what the (PARTY NAME) want to do, and that's set a date for withdrawal, even those who opposed the war from the beginning don't think that that would lead to anything but an enormously challenging situation as a result.</p><p><b>russert:</b> but, senator, the iraqi parliament, a majority of the iraqi parliament, has signed a petition asking for a date certain for withdrawal of american troops. if the iraqi parliament wants it, a majority in the congress want it...</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> mm-hmm.</p><p><b>russert:</b> ...then why do you stand there and say, "no, you can't have it"?</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> because it's my job to give my best estimate to the american people, no matter what the political calculations may be, as to what's the best in our nation's national security interest. young men and women are risking their lives as we speak in, in, in iraq. and i know that they will be in greater harm's way if we withdraw from iraq, as we keep debating over and over and over again. and i know what's best, in my mind, in my experience, in my knowledge, in my inspiration, as to what's best for this country. so political calculations such as polls, i understand that if the american people don't continue to support this effort that we will be forced to withdraw. but it's also my obligation to tell the american people and my constituents in arizona that i represent, what the consequences of failure will be; and i believe they will be catastrophic.</p><p><b>russert:</b> but the duly elected people's bodies, the u.s. congress and the iraqi parliament, say they want a troop withdrawal. that's more than a poll. isn't that the voice of the people?</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> well, the--as far as the iraqi parliament is concerned, the iraqi government obviously doesn't feel that way, their--the representatives in their government. second of all, there is some, a certain amount of domestic political calculations involved there in what the iraqi, quote, "parliament" said. the iraqi parliament has their ability to, to voice their views, and i respect them. and i, as i say, i--i'll repeat again, i understand how democracies work. i saw it in vietnam. i saw it in vietnam. and i saw it in vietnam, the predictions, that everything would be a worker's paradise in, in vietnam if we left. and thousands were executed and millions went to re-education camps. so i, i believe that, that the consequences of failure, and particularly sitting on the large reserves of oil they have, particularly considering the influence of al-qaeda is concerned, you will see enormous destabilization in the region, and that's my duty. that's my obligation. it's not my privilege. and political calculations should not enter into any information or position that i take on, on a, on an issue of national security.</p><p><b>russert:</b> the iraqi parliament says they want to take a two-month vacation while our men and women shed their blood.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> i am, i am unalterably opposed to it. one of the real difficulties we face in this conflict, obviously, is whether the maliki government will act as an inclusive government, and whether the maliki government will do the things that are necessary to be done. and i'm very concerned about it. all of us are very concerned about it. this government has to pass the oil revenue sharing law. this government has to pass de-baathification. they have to declare elections in the provinces so that sunni, who now want to take part in the electoral process, can have their representatives.</p><p><b>russert:</b> they've had four years to do this.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> they have had this time, and they have done some things. it took us about 100 and some years before we had a bloody civil war to decide the future of our country. this is a fledgling democracy. i'm not, i'm not making excuses for it, but they have not been in this business before. and yet that does not change the fact that, in my view, unless they act, it could jeopardize what is already in jeopardy.</p><p><b>russert:</b> would you be in favor of a referendum amongst the iraqi people to make a decision as to whether u.s. troops should stay or leave?</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> no, no more than i should--would have a referendum in the united states of america as to whether iraqi troops should leave, or whether we should be in or out of nato, or any other issue. the iraqi government is an elected government, and they are functioning. and so why we would need a, quote, "referendum" is no more necessary in this country as in that one. does the maliki government have to act more effectively, more inclusively? absolutely they do, and it's of great concern, and i think it's one of the great vulnerabilities as we try to move forward and succeed there. now, what's success? economic, political and social progress, which can only be obtained in an environment of security. neighborhoods in baghdad are safer. they're not safe, but they are safer than they were before. and the government has to function more effectively, and then the iraqi military and police take over those responsibilities as we gradually withdraw. that's the recipe for success.</p><p><b>russert:</b> the iraqi army, over 120 battalions.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> yep.</p><p><b>russert:</b> there are only 10 battalions--10! that's 6,000 soldiers...</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> mm-hmm. mm-hmm.</p><p><b>russert:</b> ...that are independently working separate and apart from americans. how can it be, after four years, the iraqis only have 6,000 soldiers operating independently?</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> well, two things. one, because the war was so badly mismanaged. the--secretary rumsfeld claimed that there was, at one point, i believe, 175,000 trained, and they obviously fell apart. there's a difference, though, between those who can, can perform, quote, "independently," and those that can perform effectively alongside u.s. troops in baghdad and around the country. there are--there are iraqi units that still probably can't stand up on their own, but they can operate effectively alongside u.s. military. the key to it is, will we be able to train more who can operate independently on their own? we have a ways to go. but we, again, with this new strategy--and it is a strategy, not a surge--we have been able to see significant improvement. enough improvement? probably not. but at least we're seeing some progress. and our commanders on the ground are saying that the iraqi military is functioning far more effectively, effective, and we are seeing progress there.</p><p><b>russert:</b> jim miklaszewski, our pentagon correspondent, reports that he's being told by senior military officials that, come april, we do not have the troops to continue to send to iraq in the rotation that we've been--that's been ongoing. we simply don't have them.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> come next april.</p><p><b>russert:</b> that's correct.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> we are increasing the size of the army and marine corps. another one of the great failings when we began this was not increasing the size of the army and marine corps. i've said for years that we need to dramatically increase them, particularly in certain specialties. i hope that the increased recruitment that we are experiencing now will give us an opportunity to increase those numbers. i also hope that we can see some signs of success in this challenge that we are facing.</p><p><b>russert:</b> general petraeus said this: "any student of history recognizes there's no military solution to a problem like that in iraq, to the insurgency of iraq."</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> and, you know, i've had many conversations with general petraeus and i don't want to put words in his mouth, but he'll also tell you that history shows us, any student of history will tell, you that in--if--unless you have an environment of security for the people to try to live normal lives, and the economic, politically--political and social environment is able to grow and flourish, then you are doomed to failure. so, when you say it's all we--it's all up to the iraqis, that's like saying a neighborhood that's been taken over by gangs, it's up to the people in the neighborhood. we have to do whatever we can to provide them with an environment in which they can exist and begin to lead normal lives. we are showing some success. the, the strategy before was, "go kill people." it was the old search-and-destroy. "go kill people and go back to your base." we've now got 53 or more outposts in baghdad where iraqi and american military are 24/7. there are some progress being made, and general petraeus will say that, too. enough? we'll see.</p><p><b>russert:</b> it's been more than four years.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> i know.</p><p><b>russert:</b> and the american people are saying, "why are we shedding our blood, and they're taking vacations as a parliament?" they don't have independent soldiers and battalions up and running. our "national intelligence estimate" "outlines increasingly perilous situation in which the united states has little control" "strong possibility of further deterioration, according to sources familiar with the document.</p><p>"it couches glimmers of optimism in deep uncertainty about whether the iraqi leaders will be able to transcend sectarian interests," "fight against extremists, establish effective national institutions and end rampant corruption."</p><p>that's our own intelligence agency...</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> yes.</p><p><b>russert:</b> ...four years out.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> yes, and these same intelligence agencies gave us some very bad intelligence about four years ago, as well, as you might--as you might recall. but the fact, the fact is, this is long, hard difficult. and we talk about these present challenges that we face. we don't talk a lot about what happens if we fail, and i think that that's got to be part of any national discussion that we have. and the consequences of failure are chaos, genocide and, when you--when--and i'm sure you will ask this at some point, what's plan b? my, my, my question to those who say, "let's set a date for withdrawal," what's your plan b? and the fact is, if we spent time on plan a, we, we, and give it a chance to succeed, i think would be a useful way of spending our time.</p><p><b>russert:</b> but under your plan, you're strongly suggesting we're going to be there for the next 10 years at least in order to secure and stabilize that country.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> i am suggesting that we will have--hopefully reach a situation where american troops will not be on the front lines, where--and, by the way, that will not be immediately--where american troops are able to withdraw. we've had troops in south korea for 60 years, and americans are, are very satisfied with that situation. the key to it is, is the iraqi military and police taking over these responsibilities. and that is, i believe, the ultimate way we're going to know whether we can reduce american casualties and they take over the responsibilities for, for governing their own country and militarily attacking and resisting al-qaeda and other sectarian violence which will be there for a long, long time.</p><p><b>russert:</b> and we're going to be there for a long time.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> but if it is--if it is--if it is only in a role that is of support and american casualties are minimal, then i think it's probably worth the investment. if the level of casualties stays where it is and we do not have success, then we know that that will be a, a condition that we cannot stand for.</p><p><b>russert:</b> by when?</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> i don't have a date. i think that the important thing is whether we assess as we move along. everybody talks about--some people talk about april or may--august. some people talk about september. the fact is that we've got to be showing progress along the way, and we will be--have plenty of time to assess that.</p><p>look, tim, i understand you, you are voicing the frustration that americans feel. we've only got four of the five brigades over there now. we have just begun this new strategy. it is barely beginning, and i think it ought to be given a chance to succeed or fail. and for us to, to go for two months of funding after we voted time and time again. the president, the president has vetoed, and we continue to, to try to micromanage this war, and, and if you want us out of there, then cut off the funding and bring them home tomorrow.</p><p><b>russert:</b> let me show you the kinds of things that are often said when soldiers are overseas, like this: "there's no reason for the united states to remain. the american people want them home. i believe the majority of congress wants them home. our continued military presence allows another situation to rise, which could then lead to the wounding, killing or capture of american fighting men and women. we should do all in our power to avoid that. what should be the criteria is our immediate, orderly withdrawal. and if we do not do that and other americans die then i" "say that the responsibilities for that lie with the congress who did not exercise their authority under the constitution. for us to get into nation-building, law and order, etc., i think, is a tragic and terrible mistake."</p><p>you hear those kinds of words, right?</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> sure i do. americans are frustrated and saddened by the enormous sacrifice we've made and the gross mismanagement of the war. now, my response to that statement is and what happens after we leave? listen to all of the experts who will tell you that we can have a situation in the region which will, in, in the long run, entail far greater casualties, far greater dislocation, far greater threats to our national security than trying to give this an opportunity to succeed. that's what the--my response to that heartfelt statement is.</p><p><b>russert:</b> well, those are your words from 1993 about somalia.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> mm-hmm.</p><p><b>russert:</b> and that's the kind of thing we're hearing about iraq.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> mm-hmm.</p><p><b>russert:</b> you felt that way about somalia when you saw no end in sight.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> yes, i did, and...</p><p><b>russert:</b> and many americans now are echoing your words about iraq, because they see no end in sight.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> well, if you compare--want to compare somalia to what's at stake in iraq, please feel free to do so. i don't see any comparison except that there was chaos in the streets of mogadishu, and this now is got to do with vital national security interests. i also said that we should get out of beirut when we did, because a, a presence of a few marines in a barracks was not going to, in any way, significantly impact what was going on in lebanon. and i was right, and a lot of young marines died because we--of the way that we put a presence in there without any chance of success.</p><p><b>russert:</b> you say we're making progress. you've been on this program talking about iraq. in 2003...</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> mm-hmm.</p><p><b>russert:</b> ...you said, "i believe we've achieved significant goals"; 2005, we view it as, as "hopeful," we're making "progress"; 2006, we're on the "right track," "i want to emphasize again" the "good things happening"; we're "showing signs of success" in 2007. it's upbeat, upbeat, upbeat.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> i think...</p><p><b>russert:</b> and yet the reality is quite different than that kind of optimistic message.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> you know, tim, i think it would be fair also to put the statements that i made when i came back from iraq that said it was a failed policy, that we had to have more troops on the ground, that we were not carrying out the right kind of effort at training and equipping the iraqis, that the iraqi government wasn't--so it might be fair to flash some of those statements up, including the long speech i gave, after i came back from iraq, to the council on foreign relations, where i said if we pursue this failed policy, we will fail in iraq. so i think that that might balance it out a bit. do i think we had, we had made some progress? yes. and do i think that we have had some significant setbacks? yes. we-- both is--are the case.</p><p><b>russert:</b> you made a lot of news back in april when you went to iraq. you went on a radio show and said never--had a news conference, "never been able to go out in the city as i was today." and then later these photographs were released, where we saw--(clears throat) excuse me--(candidate full) in the marketplace, surrounded, wearing a flack jacket. the next day the papers said that, "a day after members of an american congressional delegation led by senator (candidate full) pointed to their brief visit" in "baghdad's central market as evidence that the new security plan for the city was working, the merchants were incredulous about" "americans' conclusions. 'what are they talking about?'" "the owner of an electrical supply shop said. 'the security procedures were abnormal.' the delegation arrived at the market" "more than 100 soldiers in armored humvees--the equivalent of an entire company," "attack helicopters circled overhead, a senior" "military official in baghdad said. the soldiers redirected traffic from the area" "restricted access to the american." "the congressmen wore bulletproof vests" through the hour-long visit. 'they paralyzed the market when they came,'" "'this was only for the media.'"</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> well, i don't...</p><p><b>russert:</b> wasn't that...</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> ...i don't know who mr. faiyad is, and i'm sorry that i didn't see him. i talked with many, many of the merchants. we stayed there for more, more than an hour. that same place was not a functioning market a short time before. a bomb had gone off in that area and killed many, many people. there, there was a group of people that i talked to, as i traveled--walked around that, that shopping area for over an hour who said, "i'm glad to see you. things are better." they--some--a guy came and complained about a sniper that, that they'd had problems with, and the police chief we talked to about that.</p><p>my point is the neighborhoods are safer. they are not safe. that's why we have to continue what we're doing. we have a new strategy that, that can succeed. i was glad to walk through that market. i will go walk through a market as often as i can. it was not allowed to go through a market a short time before that.</p><p><b>russert:</b> but, senator, you had an armed escort.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> i had an armed escort because, because that's what general petraeus thought we ought to have. i was glad to go outside of baghdad and have over an hour opportunity to talk to the people that i talked to. now, they are very different from the people that, that you are quoting here and others. they said, "i'm glad to see you. things are better here. we have, we have seen improvement." that's what i was told, and that's what the other two members of congress were told when we were there. you can find a lot of difference of opinion if you want to, but i believe that it's important for me to go out and meet those people if i can and be around them. i didn't call for the kind of, quote, "protection" that was around me. but i am not afraid, and i'm glad to go any place that i can to talk to the people of iraq and tell them of my commitment to see that they have a free, (PARTY NAME) government where they don't have to face the bombs going off and the suicide bombers and the--and can start leading normal lives. and i'll do that every chance i get.</p><p><b>russert:</b> but the military felt you needed that protection, and the number of suicide bombers has gone up since the surge began.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> the military--the suicide bombers have gone up because they know that this is probably the most effective way publicitywise. it's not the most effective way if you're talking about winning a conflict. suicide bombers are the most difficult of any to counter, people who are willing to take their own lives in order to take others'. you can ask the israelis; i think they'll tell you that. they have literally sealed their borders, and yet suicide bombers get across. and again, is this long and hard and difficult?
