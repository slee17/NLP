(candidate full). </p><p>the public financing system, adopted in the wake of watergate, may indeed be imperfect and in need of reform. but for (candidate full) that is a problem best dealt with, conveniently enough, after the election. </p><p>we occasionally grow weary of the term "flip-flop" during political campaigns. in this case we're satisfied to use "broken promise." </p><p><a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/opinion/editorials/view.bg?articleid=1102174&amp;format=text"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the boston herald editorial <b></b></p><p>pbs' "newshour" <br/>june 20, 2008 </p><p>mark shields: "(candidate full) made history this week. he became the first presidential nominee since richard nixon in 1972 to state that his campaign will be funded totally by private donations with no limits on spending. </p><p>"it was a flip-flop of epic proportions. it was one that he could not rationalize or justify. his video was unconvincing. he looked like someone who was being kept as a hostage somewhere he was so absolutely unconvincing in it. it could not have passed a polygraph test. </p><p>"i mean, coming up with this bogus argument the (PARTY NAME)s have so much more money -- the (PARTY NAME)s don't have so much more money. he's raised three times as much as (candidate full) has. </p><p>"he has every possible committee, except (PARTY NAME) national committee, (PARTY NAME) at the senate level, congressional level have this lopsided edge over (PARTY NAME)s. they spent three times as much, did (PARTY NAME) leaning 527s, in the last election as did (PARTY NAME)s. </p><p>"so what (candidate last) didn't admit was, up until february of this year, when he told tim russert that not only would he aggressively seek an agreement on public financing, that he personally would sit down with (candidate full) and work it out, then, all of a sudden, they realized that all these small contributions were coming in and he was going to have a financial advantage in the fall against the (PARTY NAME), and they grabbed it." <b></b></p><p>judy woodruff: "well, david, would it have helped (candidate last) if he had just come out and said, 'look, i think i'm raising more money, and i'm raising small contributions, and i've just changed my mind?'" <b></b></p><p>david brooks: "it would have at least been honest, as opposed to sort of operatic, which that video was. he treated it as if some noble decision to finalize democracy. it was ludicrous. </p><p>"i do think it's the low point of the (candidate last) candidacy, and i think it for this reason. his entire career he has put political reform at the center of it. in the illinois legislature, in the senate, political reform has been the essence of who he has been. and so for him to betray this, to sell out this issue, what won't he sell out? </p><p>"and it really reveals something about his conscience. it reveals that he has this idealistic side, which is a serious policy side, but he also has a tough machiavellian side, a political hack side, and he wants to win. </p><p>"and so, in some ways, this is terrible because it's epic hypocrisy." </p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh59zig6icq"><b><i><u> watch</u></i></b> </a> the "newshour"</p></span>
