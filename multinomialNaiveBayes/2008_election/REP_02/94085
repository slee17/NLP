<span class="displaytext">manchester, nh -- u.s. senator (candidate full)'s presidential campaign announced today that members of its maine leadership team gathered in hampden this morning to draw a contrast between (candidate last)'s comprehensive proposal to reduce america's dependence on foreign oil and (candidate full)'s "dr. no" approach to energy policy. representative josh tardy (r-newport), who serves as vice chair of (candidate last)'s maine campaign and is the house (PARTY NAME) leader, and john cashwell, former mayor of bangor and calais, led a press conference on energy prices at dysart's truck stop in hampden. <p>"it is important for maine voters to know that there are clear and significant differences between (candidate full) and senator (candidate last) when it comes to leading america out of our energy crisis," tardy said. "(candidate last) knows that it is time for americans to get serious about our country's long-term energy security. he believes we must use every resource at our disposal to get the job done and has put forth an 'all of the above' proposal to lead america to energy independence. (candidate last) is clearly the only candidate in this election who has the energy and vision to reduce energy prices for maine residents and all americans." </p><p>cashwell added: "(candidate full), like people here in maine, understands that a serious challenge requires serious solutions. he recognizes it will take a combination of drilling, nuclear power, and developing advanced alternative energies to make america energy independent. (candidate full)'s belief that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing resources demonstrates his inexperience and lack of understanding for the challenges the american people face." </p><p>for more information about the lexington project, (candidate full)'s comprehensive plan to break our dependence on foreign oil, visit <a href="http://www.(candidate full).com">www.(candidate full).com</a>.</p></span>
