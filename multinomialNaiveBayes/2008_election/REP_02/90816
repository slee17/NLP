<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, u.s. senator (candidate full) issued the following statement welcoming the missile defense pact with poland: <p>"i welcome the announcement that the united states and poland have agreed on a missile defense plan for europe. as i noted during my meeting last month with polish foreign minister radek sikorski, this constitutes an important step forward in protecting european nations from a growing threat -- missile attacks from states like iran. while i have welcomed u.s. offers to work with russia on this system and share in its benefits, i was disappointed in russia's reaction to the announcement. threatening attacks against poland, a nato ally, is a wholly inappropriate response to an agreement that is not aimed at countering russia. </p><p>"rather than exchanging charges over missile defense, i would urge moscow to comply with the ceasefire in georgia and immediately begin withdrawing its forces from sovereign georgian territory. i welcome secretary rice's visit to tbilisi and believe that the entire international community should do its utmost to bring aid to the georgian people."</p></span>
