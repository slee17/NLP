(candidate last) attacked (candidate last) for having a top financial advisor who supported a deregulation bill a few years ago. yet two top (candidate last) financial advisors, with whom he met on friday to help him form his response to the current troubles on wall street, supported the sa me bill, which was signed by president (candidate last). ... this is not the (candidate full) so many voters in new hampshire and elsewhere thought they knew. but it is the real (candidate full). for despite his rhetoric, he is in fact campaigning so dishonestly that even the washington post and the new york times have called him on it. which means that he is in practice no different from those regular politicians against whom his entire campaign has been built."
