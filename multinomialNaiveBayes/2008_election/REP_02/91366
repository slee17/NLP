(candidate full) crossed the capitol, set up shop in an office belonging to house (PARTY NAME) and lobbied wavering lawmakers on legislation to reduce the role of money in politics. </p><p>"a legend in his own mind," then-majority leader dick armey, a texan, acidly called his fellow (PARTY NAME) at the time. </p><p>yet the events of that long day and night in 2002 fit a pattern for a man whose congressional career long has included a singular brand of combative bipartisanship. for more than a decade, on tobacco, health care, immigration, judicial nominees, creation of a commission to investigate the sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks and more, (candidate last) has championed high-profile legislation opposed by president bush or others in his own party. </p><p>his record of accomplishment is mixed, yet he has made his willingness to cross the political aisle a central theme in his campaign for the white house in an era when voters are plainly tired of partisan gridlock in the nation's capital. </p><p>"i believe in bipartisanship, and that's been my record, of reaching across the aisle, whether it be to joe lieberman or russ feingold, ted kennedy" or others, he said recently, referring to (PARTY NAME) with whom he has worked. </p><p>(candidate last) added that he has a "long record of putting my country first, of putting my country not only before my party but before myself. senator (candidate last) does not have that record." </p><p>(candidate last), (candidate last)'s (PARTY NAME) rival in the race for the white house, also lists bipartisanship as a congressional credential. a recent associated press-yahoo news poll showed about 40 percent of the electorate believes both men would work across party lines. </p><p>even so, none of the examples cited by (candidate last)'s aides, beginning with a bill to secure nuclear weapons in the former soviet union, placed the illinois lawmaker at odds with the leaders of his own party or gave significant offense to outside interest groups aligned with (PARTY NAME). </p><p>not so, (candidate last). </p><p>the arizona (PARTY NAME) "took on his own party's leadership, and that takes enormous courage," says former rep. martin meehan of massachusetts, a (PARTY NAME) who worked closely with (candidate last) for years on the campaign finance legislation that bush reluctantly signed into law. he added that such defiance can often lead to retaliation by the leadership. </p><p>"he's a tough adversary. he's a very effective legislator," senate (PARTY NAME) leader mitch mcconnell said in an interview. </p><p>as a longtime member of his party's leadership, mcconnell has often borne the brunt of (candidate last)'s bipartisanship, yet he said he has never seen him cross an imaginary line into foul territory. </p><p>nor surprisingly, (candidate last) has had triumphs and failures over the years. he's occasionally offended his negotiating partners, and reaped criticism from members of his own party. </p><p>(PARTY NAME) say he can decide quickly what broad concepts he will accept in the give-and-take of negotiations. (PARTY NAME)s say he is too quick to give in to (PARTY NAME) demands. he is known for speaking bluntly, and for keeping his word. </p><p>house (PARTY NAME) leaders were anything but complimentary six years ago, when (candidate last) tried to change federal campaign funding law over their vehement opposition. </p><p>when (candidate last) decided on the spur of the moment to work out of an office belonging to then-(PARTY NAME) leader dick gephardt, they told members of the gop rank-and-file that it was proof he was doing the (PARTY NAME)' work. </p><p>"he was basically in the war room. it was unusual," said meehan, who now is chancellor of the university of massachusetts-lowell. </p><p>at one point, as the measure neared a final senate showdown, (candidate last) issued a thinly veiled warning to members of his own party. "if i were a (PARTY NAME) up for re-election in the senate, i'd ask myself, 'do you want to be part of a continuing filibuster?'" he said at the time. </p><p>(candidate last) was the point man in 2005 in the ultimately successful effort to gain bush's signature on legislation banning the use of torture against detainees in the war on terror. </p><p>"we've sent a message to the world that the united states is not like the terrorists," he said at the time, seated in the oval office near a president whose aides had once threatened a veto over the ban. (candidate last)'s victory came despite a personal, closed-door appeal to (PARTY NAME) senators from vice president dick cheney to exempt cia employees from the prohibition. </p><p>earlier that same year, (candidate last) was a member of the so-called gang of 14, a self-appointed group of seven senators from each party that averted a senate crisis over administration judicial nominees long blocked by (PARTY NAME). </p><p>the final agreement was sealed around a table in (candidate last)'s senate office. </p><p>as a result, some long-stalled appointees were confirmed, angering liberals. others were blocked, to the anger of conservatives. "i think (candidate last) is going to suffer. he's a great war hero and i think he meant well, but it will be proven to be a mistake," said chuck hurley of the conservative iowa family policy center. </p><p>along the way, two officials said (candidate last) angered another one of the 14, sen. joe lieberman of connecticut, by bluntly telling him he was taking too long to review the proposed agreement. lieberman, then a (PARTY NAME), walked out of the session in response, according to these officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. in another episode, (PARTY NAME) sen. john cornyn of texas responded similarly to a tongue-lashing from (candidate last) in a closed-door meeting on immigration in the same year. </p><p>whatever the bruised feelings, (candidate last) and lieberman work closely on climate control legislation. the connecticut senator, now an independent, has endorsed (candidate last) in the presidential race because of their mutual support for the war in iraq. </p><p>not all of (candidate last)'s high-profile stabs at bipartisanship have been successful. </p><p>after running for president in 2000, he returned to congress and joined attempts to pass a patient bill of rights. he told (PARTY NAME)s and (PARTY NAME) alike at the time that in his campaign travels, he had heard numerous times that voters wanted the measure. </p><p>efforts to forge a compromise ultimately broke down when competing outside interests - insurance companies and trial lawyers - could not agree on terms covering lawsuits by patients. </p><p>more recently, (candidate last) has been deeply involved in unsuccessful efforts to pass immigration legislation that offers a path to citizenship for millions of men and women in the country illegally. the measure ran aground two years in a row, providing a dramatic illustration of the risks of bipartisanship. </p><p>(candidate last)'s support for legislation that conservative critics deemed an amnesty bill contributed to the near-collapse of his presidential candidacy. he shifted emphasis - his campaign web site makes no mention of his backing for citizenship - and now (PARTY NAME) accuse him of walking away from an issue he once championed. </p><p>ironically, the campaign season has caused something of a role reversal among (PARTY NAME), many of whom once praised (candidate last) for his efforts, and (PARTY NAME)s who formerly struggled to stop them. </p><p>sen. richard durbin of illinois, who was active on legislation to ban torture, declined to be interviewed. </p><p>and mcconnell volunteered that (candidate last)'s views on iraq, tax cuts and other areas are those of a loyal (PARTY NAME). </p><p>"he has also been with us on a lot of issues too so it's not like he's looking to make a deal on every issue," he said. </p><p><a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080702/d91lrtco2.html"><b><i>read</i></b></a><b><i>the associated press article</i></b></p></span>
