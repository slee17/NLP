(candidate last) says, 'i think part of the relationship will be dictated by how hamas acts, not how the united states acts.' now the (candidate last) campaign, as you can image, says that this is proof that senator (candidate last) has been consistent all along, and i should tell you that cnn asked jamie rubin earlier today for the rest of the interview or at least for a transcript and he said he didn't have it. he said he only had this particular quote he said that was e-mailed to him." <b> </b></p><p>cnn's lou dobbs: "well that seems, certainly to, as you report, to substantiate precisely what senator (candidate last) is saying." <b> </b></p><p>bash: "that's what the (candidate last) campaign is insisting and that's why they were, as you can imagine, very eager to send out this e-mail. and i can tell you at the top of the e-mail the subject header said 'jamie rubin lied.' inside the (candidate last) campaign, they are accusing jamie rubin of lying tonight. we're going wait to hear back from jamie rubin about that charge. as you can imagine, that's quite a charge to say somebody lied." <b> </b></p><p>dobbs: "it is quite a charge. it is also quite something for someone from another campaign to conflate both the role of journalism and of course political activism. let me ask you this. if we may, i'd like to provide the viewers of this broadcast a link, as you referred to it, that would give them the entire context of that interview. so if we may, i'd like to put that up on loudobbs.com for our viewers' benefits if they'd like to use it." <b> </b></p><p>bash: "i'll get it to you." <b> </b></p><p>dobbs: "great reporting and thank you very much." </p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvq1afdxuzo"><b><i><u> watch</u></i></b> </a> the cnn report on jamie rubin's lies <i> </i></p><p> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a-o2u4y7dq"><b><i><u> watch</u></i></b> </a><i> full unedited jamie rubin question-and-answer on hamas </i></p></span>
