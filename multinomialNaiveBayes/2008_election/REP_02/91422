<span class="displaytext"><b></b><p>(candidate full)<br/>fox news' "fox &amp; friends"<br/>may 1, 2008 </p><p>(candidate full): "we've got to do a lot of things, but first of all, judge, i'm sure you've noticed when we proposed this little break for americans -- particularly, as you know, low-income americans drive further and generally drive older cars, so their gasoline bill is higher -- you'd have thought it was the end of western civilization as we know it. 'oh, no. you can't do this.' think of all the bridges and pork barrel projects, think of that bridge in alaska to an island with 50 people on it. it's amazing to me, just give the american people a little break for the summer. maybe they can go a little further, maybe they can buy a better meal. </p><p>"but look in the long-term obviously it's independence on foreign oil. it's got to be nuclear, wind, solar, tide, batteries that will take a car a hundred miles. we've got to become independent of foreign oil and it's half our trade deficit. a lot of that money goes to countries that don't like us, and some of it ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations. </p><p>"so we can go to conservation and nuclear power, and i'm still disappointed in the extremist environmental organizations that still reject nuclear power, it's got to be part of any solution. and technology, innovation, and green technologies, and america can do this. and to say that we can't, i think flies in the face of america's history of facing and overcoming challenges. my friends, we can do it." </p><p><a href="http://blip.tv/file/869653/"><b><i><u> watch</u></i></b> </a> (candidate full) on fox news' "fox &amp; friends"</p></span>
