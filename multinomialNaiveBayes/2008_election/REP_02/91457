a temporary worker program; and then dealing with the undocumented in the united states -- a three-legged stool. </p><p>"senator (candidate last) joined up with one of the most anti-immigrant senators, senator dorgan, to try to kill the second leg of that stool, the temporary worker program was an absolutely indispensable ingredient, and will be in the future, to immigration reform. and senator (candidate last) tried to kill the temporary worker program. he voted for the reduction from 400,000 to 200,000 temporary workers. </p><p>"and with regard to the global issue, whether on border control or whether on dealing with the people who are here, he was absolutely awol. so it is absurd for him to try to take credit now. </p><p>"again, it's part of the pattern of the problem he's going to have going into the hispanic community to try to persuade the hispanic community that he's a leader, because he has -- basically he is not known, he's not known by the hispanic community." </p><p>...</p><p>"so whether it's on the issue of immigration, where he was absolutely awol, opposition to the free trade agreements with our friends in this hemisphere, his support for massive tax increases on the over 2 million small businesses that are hispanic in this country and growing in number, on all those issues senator (candidate last) is going to have a serious problem when he tries to persuade hispanic that he's the right choice for president." </p><p><a href="http://blip.tv/file/1061882"><b><i>listen</i></b></a><b><i>to the full conference call</i></b></p></span>
