(candidate full) (r-az.), he deserves credit for trying to forge a bipartisan deal on immigration in 2005 and 2006 at great personal political risk, a situation unfamiliar to rival sen. (candidate full) (d-ill.) </p><p>(candidate last) put his comeback presidential bid in peril because of his leadership role with sen. ted kennedy (d-mass.) to find a path for millions of illegal immigrants to stay in the u.s. </p><p>the kennedy-(candidate last) legislation stalled in 2006, because the hardline pro- and anti-immigration forces preferred the status quo to a compromise. another try in 2007 -- in a bill backed by (candidate last) and (candidate last) -- also failed. </p><p>(candidate last) and (candidate last), wooing hispanic voters, each has madeclear in recent appearances before the national association of latino elected officials and the league of united latino american citizens a few days ago that he would make immigration reform -- and legalizing the status of millions of illegal immigrants -- a priority if elected president. i expect each to send the same message at the upcoming national council of la raza conference in san diego, where (candidate last) speaks sunday and (candidate last) on monday. </p><p>in the meantime, (candidate last) on the campaign trail inflates his leadership role -- casting himself as someone who could figure out how to get something done. (candidate last) "did not absolutely stand out in any way,'' said margaret sands orchowski, the author of "immigration and the american dream: battling the political hype and hysteria," and a close follower of the legislation. </p><p>sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.), a (candidate last) ally and a key player on immigration, said (candidate last) was around for only a "handful" of meetings and helped destroy a 2007 compromise when he voted for making guest worker visa programs temporary. a permanent guest worker program was to be a trade for a legalization program to cover many illegal immigrants. </p><p>"when it came time to putting that bill together, he was more of a problem than he was a help. and when it came time to try to get the bill passed, he, in my opinion, broke the agreement we had. he was in the photo op, but he could not execute the hard part of the deal," graham said. </p><p>an (candidate last) senate staffer who did not want his name used disputed whether the sunset provision in the guest worker program killed the bill and said that either (candidate last) or his top immigration staffer were in strategy sessions and that kennedy, in his speech endorsing (candidate last) vouched for (candidate last)'s work on immigration. </p><p>on thursday in fairfax, va., (candidate last) was asked about his qualifications to understand latino needs. after noting his work as a community organizer and state senator -- he spoke of (candidate last). "(candidate full) bucked much of his party and worked with ted kennedy, worked with me and others to help shape comprehensive immigration reform legislation in the senate. and i thought that was courageous of him." (candidate last), in a sly verbal stroke, made himself an equal on immigration leadership to kennedy and demoted (candidate last) to a helper. </p><p>(candidate last) -- after the two failed attempts to pass a comprehensive bill -- now wants to satisfy conservatives by first passing a border security and enforcement measure. </p><p>(candidate last) said that approach means (candidate last) "can't give you confidence that he is going to be serious about that issue. i will be." </p><p>(candidate last) is not saying enforcement only. he is saying enforcement first. </p><p><a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/1052512,cst-nws-sweet12.article"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the column</p></span>
