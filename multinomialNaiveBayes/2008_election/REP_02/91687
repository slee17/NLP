<span class="displaytext">henderson, nv -- the (candidate last)-palin campaign today issued the following statement from ty cobb, nevada sportsmen for (candidate last) co-chair, regarding (candidate full)'s comments about governor sarah palin on monday in farmington hills, michigan. (candidate last) derided gov. palin for being a "mother, governor, moose shooter" while the crowd booed and laughed. <p><b>ty cobb, nevada sportsmen for (candidate last) co-chair: </b>"time and again, (candidate full) has proven that he does not understand that the right to bear arms is every citizen's basic constitutional right. he wants to take guns from law-abiding citizens and appoint federal judges who feel the same. he is clearly out of touch with americans, especially those of us in the west. unlike their opponents, (candidate full) and sarah palin are strong supporters of the second amendment. (candidate last) understands that we must prosecute criminals to the fullest extent of the law, rather than forcing law-abiding citizens to give up their constitutional rights. the differences between the two nominees for president are vast, especially on this issue, and the choice is clear if you want to maintain your rights." </p><p><b><u>fact: before running for president, (candidate last) expressed support for banning many types of firearms: </u></b> </p><p><b>on 1996 questionnaire, (candidate last) answered "yes" to question about his support for legislation to "ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns." </b>question: "do you support state legislation to ... ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns?
