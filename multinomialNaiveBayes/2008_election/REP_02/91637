"here's rep. robert wexler of florida: (candidate full)'s decision to select a vice presidential running mate that endorsed pat buchanan for president in 2000 is a direct affront to all jewish americans. pat buchanan is a nazi sympathizer with a uniquely atrocious record on israel, even going as far as to denounce bringing former nazi soldiers to justice and praising adolf hilter for his 'great courage.'"

(cnn's "the situation room," 9/2/08) <b> </b></p><p>(PARTY NAME) strategist paul begala falsely smeared governor palin saying she supposedly cutting special needs funding in alaska. begala: "she did sell it. but here's what bothers me more, the press has ignored this and i don't know why. she said, let me quote from her speech: 'to the families of special needs children, i pledge to you that if we are elected we will have a friend and advocate in the white house.' this is the mother of a special needs baby, who heroically chose live, to give that down syndrome baby life who is also the aunt, we learned from kyra phillips reporting in anchorage, of another special needs child and yet she cut funding for special needs education by 62 percent. it was $8.2 million when she came in, she cut it down to $3 million. now, that's a real issue. there are lots of moms and dads who have chosen life and who love their special needs babies in alaska who now are not going to get the help they need because sarah palin put politics first. i think that's a more legitimate fib to talk about from sarah palin's speech."
