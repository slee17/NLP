<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, (candidate last) 2008 senior foreign policy advisor randy scheunemann issued the following statement: <p>"(candidate full) has said repeatedly that, if elected president, he would summon the joint chiefs of staff and give them a new mission: get all u.s. forces out of iraq within 16 months, regardless of the conditions on the ground. today, chairman of the joint chiefs admiral mike mullen, the nation's highest ranking officer, made clear that he believes such an approach could be 'very dangerous.' admiral mullen further added that his view is shared by u.s. commanders in iraq, who are 'adamant about continuing progress, about making decisions based on what's actually happening in the battle space.' (candidate full) says he wants a 'safe and responsible' withdrawal from iraq, but is stubbornly adhering to an unconditional withdrawal that places politics above the advice of our military commanders, the success of our troops, and the security of the american people. (candidate full) is wrong to advocate withdrawal at any cost just as he was wrong to oppose the surge that has put victory within reach. it is a strategy for defeat, and it is the only strategy (candidate full) has ever supported."</p></span>
