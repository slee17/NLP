<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full)'s presidential campaign today released the following statement by communications director jill hazelbaker on senator (candidate full)'s intellectually dishonest attacks on (candidate full) today: <p>"at a time when senator (candidate last) knows that american and allied forces are making real progress in iraq, it is unfortunate that she would look to score political points by mischaracterizing senator (candidate last)'s statement with intellectually dishonest attacks. the differences between senator (candidate last)'s position, that we must win this war, and senator (candidate last)'s position, withdrawal and de facto surrender on day one, are important enough to have an honest debate over. it would be the height of irresponsibility to stick with campaign promises to the left-wing of the (PARTY NAME) party and proceed with withdrawal regardless of what the situation is on the ground in iraq in january 2009. the point that senator (candidate last) was making was one about american troop presence versus american combat presence. he was speaking of a post-war scenario, not a hundred year war, when he suggested that the american people could support maintaining a military presence in iraq should the iraqi and u.s. governments determine it to be in their mutual interest, just as the u.s. and german, japanese, and south korean governments did after conflicts. one would suspect senator (candidate last) is aware that american troops have been present peacefully in germany and japan for more than six decades. the american people deserve more than blatant mischaracterizations, and we invite senator (candidate last) to participate with us in an honest debate."</p></span>
