<span class="displaytext"> <p>arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full) today issued the following statement on the situation in tibet: </p><p>"the unfolding tragedy in tibet should draw the attention of the entire world. i deplore the violent crackdown by chinese authorities and the continuing oppression in tibet of those merely wishing to practice their faith and preserve their culture and heritage. i have listened carefully to the dalai lama and am convinced he is a man of peace who reflects the hopes and aspirations of tibetans. i urge the government of the people's republic of china to address the root causes of unrest in tibet by opening a genuine dialogue with his holiness, the dalai lama. reports of shutting down youtube and confiscation of sim cards are disturbing and reports of multiple deaths are far more so, especially in a year when china is preparing to host the olympic games. i urge the chinese authorities to ensure peaceful protest is not met with violence, to release monks and others detained for peacefully expressing their views and to allow full outside access to tibet."</p></span>
