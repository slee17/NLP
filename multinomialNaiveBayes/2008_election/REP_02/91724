<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full)'s presidential campaign today issued the following statement from (candidate last) campaign manager rick davis in response to (candidate full)'s comments in springfield, rolla and union, missouri, yesterday:<p>"(candidate full) has played the race card, and he played it from the bottom of the deck. it's divisive, negative, shameful and wrong."</p><p><b><u>(candidate full)'s comments yesterday in springfield, rolla and union, missouri:</u></b></p><p><b>(candidate full) in springfield, missouri:</b> "so nobody really thinks that bush or (candidate last) have a real answer for the challenges we face, so what they're going to try to do is make you scared of me. you know, he's not patriotic enough. he's got a funny name. you know, he doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills, you know. he's risky. that's essentially the argument they're making."
