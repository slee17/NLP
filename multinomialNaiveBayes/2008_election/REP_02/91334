(candidate last) as the 44th president of the united states. </p><p>(candidate last)'s lifelong record of service to america, his battle-tested courage, unshakeable devotion to principle and clear grasp of the dangers and opportunities now facing the nation stand in dramatic contrast to the tissue-paper-thin resume of his (PARTY NAME) opponent, freshman sen. (candidate full). </p><p>(candidate last) has been in washington for many years now, but he is not of washington. he knows where the levers of power are located - and how to manipulate them - but he is not controlled by them. </p><p>(candidate last)'s selection of the charming, but rock-solid, outsider sarah palin as his running mate underscores the point. </p><p>neither plays well with others. </p><p>and this is an unalloyed asset at a time when special interests - lobbyists, lawyers and organized labor chief among them - wield enormous influence in the nation's capital. </p><p>(candidate last)'s (PARTY NAME) opponents, (candidate last) and sen. (candidate full), lead a party constructed of special interests - public-employee unionists in particular. </p><p>there are many reasons to support the (candidate last)-palin ticket. here are but a few: </p><p>national security: the differences between (candidate last) and (candidate last) are especially stark. </p><p>(candidate last) says 9/11 represented a two-decade "failure ... to respond to ... a [growing] global terror network." he understood that iraq is a critical front in the war on terror - and he urged perseverance even in the dark days that preceded the success of "the surge." </p><p>(candidate last) backed policies that would have abandoned iraq to its fate, he bitterly opposed the surge, and once insisted that us forces invade pakistan in search of osama bin laden - seemingly without regard for the potential consequences of attacking a nuclear-armed nation, ally or not. </p><p>regarding a nuclear iran, (candidate last) has pushed for the strongest possible international sanctions and diplomatic pressure. (candidate last) opposes sanctions. </p><p>and, when russia invaded the former soviet republic of georgia, threatening a return to the cold war, (candidate last) reacted with stern disapprobation: "we must remind russia's leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values, stability and peace of that world." </p><p>(candidate last) called for un action - unaware, apparently, that russia's security council veto would have prevented any. </p><p>taxes: (candidate last) knows that when government absorbs ever-larger shares of national income, the economy suffers. </p><p>high tax rates diminish investment, killing jobs and stunting growth. </p><p>and while (candidate last) promises tax cuts for "95 percent" of americans, what he actually is proposing is some $650 billion in tax-credit-driven hikes in entitlement and other spending, to be paid for with heavier imposts across the board, but especially on investment - like a sharply higher capital-gains tax. </p><p>this is bad news for the millions of ordinary americans who own stocks, either personally or through pension funds or who plan someday to sell their homes or other real property. </p><p>(candidate last), wisely, vows to keep capital-gains taxes at 15 percent and to keep the bush-era tax cuts in place - understanding that new growth will boost revenue, and promising to make up the rest with spending restraint. </p><p>and he's called for a one-year freeze on most discretionary spending and an end to pork-barrel giveaways. </p><p>trade: "i object when senator (candidate last) and others preach the false virtues of economic isolationism," says (candidate last) - noting that "globalization is an opportunity" for us workers. he adds that while emerging economies like those of china and india are worrisome, the answer is competition informed by education and innovation - not protectionism. </p><p>energy: on the economic issue most vexing americans today - energy prices - (candidate last) is aggressive </p><p>he is a strong convert to offshore drilling: "we have trillions of dollars' worth of oil and gas reserves in the us at a time we are exporting hundreds of billions of dollars a year overseas to buy energy." </p><p>he also strongly backs nuclear power - a carbon-free form of energy that america can produce relatively cheaply. </p><p>(candidate last), meanwhile, hews to the (PARTY NAME) party line on energy: no nukes, no drilling and no comprehension of the consequences of such policies. </p><p>none of this implies an iota of disrespect toward (candidate last). it took a formidable candidacy to defeat sen. hillary rodham (candidate last) - a candidacy, by the way, which we strongly supported earlier this year. </p><p>and the intelligence, the organizational skills and the ability to communicate that (candidate last) demonstrated from the beginning dramatically underscore the history that is being made by the first african-american to head a major-party presidential ticket. </p><p>he should be around for a long time, and we hope that he is. </p><p>in the end, though, sound security, economic and energy policies - plus allegiance to principle - are critical to keeping america safe and strong. </p><p>on all counts, (candidate full) and sarah palin understand this - and that's why we're in their corner to the finish. </p><p><a href="http://www.nypost.com/php/pfriendly/print.php?url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/09082008/postopinion/editorials/post_endorses_john_(candidate last)_128044.htm"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the editorial</p></span>
