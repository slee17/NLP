(candidate last)'s past: voting present." -- peter wallison </p><p>"(candidate last) voted 'present' on mortgage reform" <br/>peter j. wallison<br/><i>the wall street journal<br/></i>october 15, 2008  </p><p>in each of the first two presidential debates, (candidate full) claimed that "(PARTY NAME) deregulation" is responsible for the financial crisis. most viewers probably accepted this idea, especially because (PARTY NAME)s generally do favor deregulation. </p><p>but one essential fact was missing from the senator's narrative: while there has been significant deregulation in the u.s. economy during the last 30 years, none of it has occurred in the financial sector. indeed, the only significant legislation with any effect on financial risk-taking was the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991, adopted during the first bush administration in the wake of the collapse of the savings and loans (s&amp;ls). fdicia, however, substantially tightened commercial bank and s&amp;l regulations, including prompt corrective action when a bank's capital declines below adequate levels and severe personal fines if management violates laws or regulations. </p><p>if sen. (candidate last) had been asked for an example of "(PARTY NAME) deregulation," he would probably have cited the gramm-leach-bliley act of 1999 (glba), which has become a popular target for (PARTY NAME) searching for something to pin on the gop. this is puzzling. the bill's key sponsors were indeed (PARTY NAME)s, but the bill was supported by the (candidate last) administration and signed by president (candidate last). the glba's "repeal" of a portion of the glass-steagall act of 1933 is said to have somehow contributed to the current financial meltdown. nonsense. </p><p>adopted early in the new deal, the glass-steagall act separated investment and commercial banking. it prohibited commercial banks from underwriting or dealing in securities, and from affiliating with firms that engaged principally in that business. the glba repealed only the second of these provisions, allowing banks and securities firms to be affiliated under the same holding company. thus j.p. morgan chase was able to acquire bear stearns, and bank of america could acquire merrill lynch. nevertheless, banks themselves were and still are prohibited from underwriting or dealing in securities. </p><p>allowing banks and securities firms to affiliate under the same holding company has had no effect on the current financial crisis. none of the investment banks that have gotten into trouble -- bear, lehman, merrill, goldman or morgan stanley -- were affiliated with commercial banks. and none of the banks that have major securities affiliates -- citibank, bank of america, and j.p. morgan chase, to name a few -- are among the banks that have thus far encountered serious financial problems. indeed, the ability of these banks to diversify into nonbanking activities has been a source of their strength. </p><p>most important, the banks that have succumbed to financial problems -- wachovia, washington mutual and indymac, among others -- got into trouble by investing in bad mortgages or mortgage-backed securities, not because of the securities activities of an affiliated securities firm. federal reserve regulations significantly restrict transactions between banks and their affiliates. </p><p>if sen. (candidate last) were truly looking for a kind of deregulation that might be responsible for the current financial crisis, he need only look back to 1998, when the (candidate last) administration ruled that fannie mae and freddie mac could satisfy their affordable housing obligations by purchasing subprime mortgages. this ultimately made it possible for fannie and freddie to add a trillion dollars in junk loans to their balance sheets. this led to their own collapse, and to the development of a market in these mortgages that is the source of the financial crisis we are wrestling with today. </p><p>finally, on the matter of deregulation and the financial crisis, sen. (candidate last) should consider his own complicity in the failure of congress to adopt legislation that might have prevented the subprime meltdown. </p><p>in the summer of 2005, a bill emerged from the senate banking committee that considerably tightened regulations on fannie and freddie, including controls over their capital and their ability to hold portfolios of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. all the (PARTY NAME)s voted for the bill in committee; all the (PARTY NAME) voted against it. to get the bill to a vote in the senate, a few (PARTY NAME) votes were necessary to limit debate. this was a time for the leadership sen. (candidate last) says he can offer, but neither he nor any other (PARTY NAME) stepped forward. </p><p>instead, by his own account, mr. (candidate last) wrote a letter to the treasury secretary, allegedly putting himself on record that subprime loans were dangerous and had to be dealt with. this is revealing; if true, it indicates sen. (candidate last) knew there was a problem with subprime lending -- but was unwilling to confront his own party by pressing for legislation to control it. as a demonstration of character and leadership capacity, it bears a strong resemblance to something else in sen. (candidate last)'s past: voting present. </p><p>mr. wallison is a senior fellow at the american enterprise institute. </p><p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/sb122403045717834693.html?mod=todays_us_opinion"><b><i><u> read</u></i></b> </a> the op-ed <b><i></i></b></p></span>
