(candidate last) and his congressional allies led. tough rules on wall street. stop ceo rip-offs. protect your savings and pensions. <b> </b></p><p>on friday, (candidate full) outlined a detailed economic recovery plan that called for tougher rules on wall street, including the creation of the mortgage and financial institutions trust. (candidate last): "first, to deal with the immediate crisis, i will lead in the creation of the mortgage and financial institutions trust -- the mfi. the underlying principle of the mfi or any approach considered by congress should be to keep people in their homes and safe guard the life savings of all americans by protecting our financial system and capital markets. this trust will work with the private sector and regulators to identify institutions that are weak and fix them before they become insolvent. the mfi is an early intervention program to help financial institutions avoid bankruptcy, expensive bailouts and damage to their customers. this will get the treasury and other financial regulatory authorities in a proactive position instead of reacting in a cri sis mode to one situation after another." ((candidate full), remarks, green bay, wi, 9/19/08) <b> </b></p><p>(candidate last): "reforms to prevent financial firms from concealing their bad practices." (candidate last): "second, i will propose and sign into law reforms to prevent financial firms from concealing their bad practices. an inexcusable lack of financial transparency allowed wall street firms to engage in reckless behavior that padded their profits and fattened executive bonuses when times were good, but now imperil the financial security of millions of americans when their bets turned sour." ((candidate full), remarks, green bay, wi, 9/19/08) <b> </b></p><p>(candidate last): bring "regulatory clarity" to the financial markets. (candidate last): "third, we need regulatory clarity. the lack of transparency in our financial markets went unnoticed by the regulatory agencies scattered throughout washington charged with protecting the common good. we've got the sec, the fdic, the cftc, the sipc, the occ, the fed. at best, this confusing assortment of regulators and institutions was egregiously lax in carrying out their responsibilities. at worst, they engaged in the old washington game of guarding their bureaucratic turf, instead of safeguarding the public interest and protecting investors." ((candidate full), remarks, green bay, wi, 9/19/08) <b> </b></p><p>(candidate last): protect consumers and investors. (candidate last): "fourth, we must ensure that consumers and investors are protected. our regulatory system must protect consumers and investors by punishing individuals who engage in fraud, break contracts, or lie to customers -- like the predatory lenders who know you can't afford an adjustable rate mortgage, but mislead you into signing one. these actions are criminal and the people who commit them should be behind bars." ((candidate full), remarks, green bay, wi, 9/19/08) <b> </b></p><p>(candidate last): "the consequences for corporate abuse will not be more enrichments." (candidate last): "and corporate governance rules will be reformed so that shareholders have a clear say in determining the pay of ceos and other senior executives. on my watch, the consequences for corporate abuse will not be more enrichment, but more likely an indictment." ((candidate full), remarks, green bay, wi, 9/19/08) <b> </b></p><p>(candidate last): "the treasury department will follow consistent policies in deciding whether to guarantee loans." (candidate last): "fifth, in cases where failing companies seek taxpayer bailouts, the treasury department will follow consistent policies in deciding whether to guarantee loans. it must have well developed remedies for a financial crisis. with billions of dollars in public money at stake, it will not do to keep making it up as we go along." ((candidate full), remarks, green bay, wi, 9/19/08) <b> </b></p><p>(candidate last): "the federal reserve should get back to its core business." (candidate last): "finally, the federal reserve should get back to its core business of responsibly managing our money supply and inflation. it needs to get out of the business of bailouts. the fed needs to return to protecting the purchasing power of the dollar. a strong dollar will reduce energy and food prices. it will stimulate sustainable economic growth and get this economy moving again."
