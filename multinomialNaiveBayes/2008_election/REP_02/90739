<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- u.s. senator (candidate full) today issued the following statement calling for a stop to earmarks: <p>"i am proud to have fought against the practice of earmarking and wasteful pork-barrel spending. it has often been a lonely fight, but one i know is worth winning. i am encouraged by some of my (PARTY NAME) colleagues' new-found enthusiasm for suspending this practice for a year. i hope their recent commitments do not wane once they step off the campaign trail. i believe we must end this process, which has diverted billions in taxpayer dollars to needless projects, once and for all. if voters give me the pen, i will veto every single pork-barrel bill congress sends me. </p><p>"the american people demand that we introduce transparency and good judgment in how we spend their tax dollars. if projects like the proposed taxpayer-funded woodstock concert museum were worthy national priorities, their funding would not be sought through appropriations earmarks, rather, they could withstand the public scrutiny of the regular legislative authorization process. </p><p>"i am encouraged that senators (candidate last) and (candidate last) have joined me in supporting the demint amendment banning earmarks for one year. i renew my call for them to fully disclose all of their earmark requests while serving in the senate and join me in increasing needed transparency and accountability in washington."</p></span>
