<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, chief warrant officer 4 michael j. durant (ret.) issued the following statement on (candidate full)'s apparently false accounts of near-misses on the battlefields of afghanistan and iraq: <p>"senator (candidate last) claimed at a debate last year that he'd been 'shot at' while visiting iraq. and he has claimed repeatedly, most recently last week, that his helicopter was 'forced down' in afghanistan -- leaving his audience with the impression that it was fire from the taliban which had grounded the aircraft. neither of these stories appears to be true, and senator (candidate last) has never accounted for the discrepancies. </p><p>"i've been on a helicopter that was 'forced down' by enemy fire, and i've been 'shot at.' neither is easily confused with being caught in a snow storm or awakened by a loud bang in the night. senator (candidate last) has a responsibility to come clean on what actually happened, and explain why he would ever say such things to the american people. and with the vice presidential debate coming up on thursday, it is incumbent on the news media to ask senator (candidate last) the tough questions -- as they have so far failed to do -- and examine his responses closely for inconsistencies of the kind we've witnessed in recent months. </p><p>"the american people expect and deserve leaders who tell the truth about their record and their experiences, and a news media that holds all candidates -- no matter their party -- to the same standard." <b><u> </u></b></p><p>background on michael durant <i> </i></p><p>michael durant, cw4 (retired), us army; born july 23, 1961 in berlin, nh. he entered the united states army in august 1979. following basic training he attended the defense language institute, and was then assigned to the 470th military intelligence group, fort clayton, panama as a spanish voice intercept operator. he then completed helicopter flight training at fort rucker, alabama. upon appointment to warrant officer 1 in november 1983, he completed the uh60 black hawk qualification course and was assigned to the 377th medical evacuation company, seoul korea. his next assignment was with the 101st aviation battalion, fort campbell, kentucky, where he performed duties as an instructor pilot. </p><p>michael joined the 160th special operations group on august 1, 1988. assigned to d company, he performed duties as flight lead and standardization instructor pilot. he participated in combat operations prime chance (persian gulf in 1989), just cause (panama invasion in 1989), desert storm (liberation of kuwait in 1991), and gothic serpent (somalia in 1993). </p><p>on october 3, 1993, while piloting an mh60 black hawk in mogadishu, somalia, he was shot down and held captive by hostile forces. he was released eleven days later.  <b> </b></p><p>unlike (candidate last), (candidate last) gets pass for saying he was 'shot at' in iraq </p><p>when (candidate full) told a tall tale about "landing under sniper fire" in bosnia, she was accused of "inflating her war experience" by (candidate full)'s campaign -- but the campaign has been silent about (candidate full) telling his own questionable story about being "shot at" in iraq.  </p><p>by bill sammon<br/><a href="http://www.foxnews.comseptember/"><u> www.foxnews.com</u> </a><br/>september 30, 2008<br/>http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/09/30/unlike-(candidate last)-(candidate last)-gets-pass-saying-shot-iraq/ </p><p>when (candidate full) told a tall tale about "landing under sniper fire" in bosnia, she was accused of "inflating her war experience" by rival (PARTY NAME) (candidate full)'s campaign. </p><p>but the campaign has been silent about (candidate last)'s running mate, (candidate full), telling his own questionable story about being "shot at" in iraq. </p><p>"let's start telling the truth," (candidate last) said during a presidential primary debate sponsored by youtube last year. "number one, you take all the troops out - you better have helicopters ready to take those 3,000 civilians inside the green zone, where i have been seven times and shot at. you better make sure you have protection for them, or let them die." </p><p>but when questioned about the episode afterward by the hill newspaper, (candidate last) backpedaled from his claim of being "shot at" and instead allowed: "i was near where a shot landed." </p><p>the senior senator from delaware went on to say that some sort of projectile "landed" outside a building in the green zone where he and another senator had spent the night during a visit in december 2005. the lawmakers were shaving in the morning when they felt the building shake, (candidate last) said. </p><p>"no one got up and ran from the room-it wasn't that kind of thing," he told the hill. "it's not like i had someone holding a gun to my head." </p><p>the rest of the press ignored the flap at the time because (candidate last) was viewed as having little chance of ending up on the (PARTY NAME) presidential ticket. but even after (candidate last) was selected to be (candidate last)'s running mate last month, his claim to have been "shot at" drew no scrutiny from the same reporters who had savaged (candidate last) for making a similar claim that turned out to be false. </p><p>fox news has been asking the (candidate last) campaign for details of the alleged shooting in iraq ever since (candidate last) was tapped to be vice president. (candidate last) campaign spokesman david wade promised an answer last week, but failed to provide one. </p><p>meanwhile, the gaffe-prone (candidate last) has again raised eyebrows with another story about his exploits in war zones - this time in afghanistan. (candidate last) said he will grill (PARTY NAME) rival sarah palin in thursday's vice presidential debate about "the superhighway of terror between pakistan and afghanistan where my helicopter was forced down." </p><p>"if you want to know where al qaeda lives, you want to know where bin laden is, come back to afghanistan with me," (candidate last) bragged to the national guard association. "come back to the area where my helicopter was forced down, with a three-star general and three senators at 10,500 feet in the middle of those mountains. i can tell you where they are." </p><p>but it turns out that inclement weather, not terrorists, prompted the chopper to land in an open field during (candidate last)'s visit to afghanistan in february. fighter jets kept watch overhead while a convoy of security vehicles was dispatched to retrieve (candidate last) and fellow senators chuck hagel and john kerry. </p><p>"we were going to send (candidate last) out to fight the taliban with snowballs, but we didn't have to," joked kerry, a (PARTY NAME), to the ap. "other than getting a little cold, it was fine." </p><p>(candidate last) never explicitly claimed his chopper had been forced down by terrorists. nonetheless, (candidate full) spokesman brian rogers said (candidate last)-(candidate last) officials have been less than forthcoming about (candidate last)'s dramatic war stories. </p><p>"they never explained (candidate last)'s helicopter story from last week - which is very similar to the story about getting 'shot at' in baghdad," rogers said.</p></span>
