and on the brink of a deep economic recession - he talks unabashedly about increasing the corporate tax rate and raising taxes on households making more than $250,000 a year. the reason, he said in a now-famous campaign moment, is so he can "spread the wealth around." that talk, combined with (candidate last)'s view of health care as a "right" at great expense to the taxpayer, generates legitimate concerns about (candidate last)'s desire to punish success and push the united states toward a socialist democracy. </p><p>on foreign policy, (candidate last) has weak credentials. his senate votes for hasty and unwise u.s. troop withdrawals from iraq and talk about meeting leaders of enemy nations without preconditions indicate an unsettling naivet about the dangers america faces from abroad and about our enemies' true intentions. </p><p>while (candidate last) has protectionist tendencies - a bow to the nation's union leaders - (candidate last) supports free trade. while still stubbornly opposed to drilling for oil in alaska, (candidate last) supports more drilling off the u.s. coastline and supports aggressive efforts to develop alternative energy resources and reduce u.s. dependence on foreign oil. </p><p>a former u.s. navy pilot and former prisoner of war in vietnam, (candidate last) would make a fine commander-in-chief. he consistently has supported the military during his long senate career, but he also has fought against wasteful defense spending and expensive and unnecessary defense systems. he understands the needs of the u.s. military and how best to protect u.s. national security and security interests around the globe. he consistently fought for more boots on the ground in iraq and finally got what he wanted through the u.s. troop "surge." </p><p>perhaps more importantly in a time of economic and financial crisis, (candidate last) understands that raising taxes is not the way to promote increased productivity and economic growth. he's correct in his view that higher taxes on the business sector is a recipe for further business cutbacks and job losses. and, despite his recent vote on the $700 billion federal financial bailout bill, his record shows consistent support for the conservative ideals of smaller government, fiscal restraint and personal responsibility. </p><p>(candidate last) has been roundly criticized by the (candidate last) campaign for having voted more than 90 percent of the time for policies supported by president bush, but that shouldn't be a strike against (candidate last) if most of those policies were meant to promote economic growth and u.s. national security. even with the high level of agreement with the president, (candidate last) also has very publicly opposed the white house on a number of issues, ranging from the early conduct of the war in iraq to climate change. </p><p>(candidate last) hasn't always been right. a campaign finance reform bill he co-authored in an attempt to stem political corruption was full of financial loopholes, which (candidate last) has used to his advantage. in addition, the bill was an attack on political free speech. a couple of years ago, (candidate last) also was a big backer of a senate bill to address the huge issue of illegal immigration. the legislation didn't get anywhere, because americans of all political stripes saw it as an immigrant "amnesty" bill and flooded senate offices with calls opposing it. </p><p>the campaign finance and immigration bills are examples of (candidate last)'s willingness to reach out to (PARTY NAME) to work on important issues, but they also provide evidence that even bipartisan legislation can be poor legislation. </p><p>(candidate full) is a man of great appeal, rhetorical flourishes, little political experience and left-leaning tendencies. in contrast, (candidate full) is far less eloquent, but he's experienced, he's proven in a fight and he's on target on important u.s. policies regarding taxes, spending, trade, energy and national security. </p><p>given the choice, we much prefer substance over style and experience over risky idealism. we prefer and recommend (candidate full) for president of the united states. </p><p><b><i><a href="http://www.newschief.com/article/20081027/news/810270318/1013/opinion?title=john_(candidate last)_s_experience_will_serve_u_s__well">read</a> the article</i></b></p></span>
