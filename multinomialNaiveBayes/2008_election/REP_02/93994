<span class="displaytext">arlington, va -- today, former u.s. senator phil gramm issued the following statement:<p>"it is clear to me that (PARTY NAME) want to attack me rather than debate senator (candidate last) on important economic issues facing the country. that kind of distraction hurts not only senator (candidate last)'s ability to present concrete programs to deal with the country's problems, it hurts the country. to end this distraction and get on with the real debate, i hereby step down as co-chair of the (candidate last) campaign and join the growing number of rank-and-file (candidate last) supporters."</p></span>
