<span class="displaytext"><i><b></b></i><center>"the fact that the (candidate last) campaign has not provided more information about who these small donors are really runs counter to his transparency message." -- sheila krumholz, center for responsive politics</center> <p><b>cbs' "evening news"<br/> october 27, 2008</b> </p><p><b>cbs' katie couric:</b> "if it seems that you're seeing a lot more of (candidate full) on tv, there's a good reason. he raised a lot more money than (candidate full), and since clinching the nomination in june, he's outspent him better than 2-1. so where did senator (candidate last) get that kind of cash? sharyl attkisson follows the money." </p><p><b>cbs' sharyl attkisson:</b> "early on, both (candidate full) and (candidate full) promised to limit their fundraising, but (candidate last) reversed that pledge when he won his party's nomination. now he ranks as the greatest political fundraiser of all time, more than $600 million, compared to $350 million for (candidate last). (candidate last)'s broken another record. he's gotten more money than anyone in history from unidentified donors with names like 'doodad' who lists his employer as 'loving,' and has given more than $17,000, way over federal limits." </p><p><b>(candidate full):</b> "ninety percent of our contributions are from small donors." </p><p><b>attkisson:</b> "and lots of (candidate last) donors don't have to be disclosed at all under federal law because they gave under $200. (candidate last)'s posted his small donor list online -- an imperfect list that has some cities listed as 'anonymous' -- but (candidate last) hasn't given any details at all about who his small donors are, drawing extra criticism after he raised a record-shattering $150 million last month alone." </p><p><b>center for response politics' sheila krumholz:</b> "the fact that the (candidate last) campaign has not provided more information about who these small donors are really runs counter to his transparency message." </p><p><b>attkisson:</b> "you might be surprised by who else besides those unnamed small donors is on the (candidate last) team. like (candidate last), (candidate last)'s corporate donor list reads like a who's who of the wall street collapse, only some are giving more to (candidate last) -- lots more." </p><p><b>krumholz:</b> "the (candidate last) campaign has just vacuumed up the money in this cycle, specifically from goldman sachs. (candidate last) has received over $740,000, as compared to (candidate last)'s $220,000." </p><p><b>attkisson:</b> "not to mention that the former head of goldman sachs, robert rubin, is (candidate last)'s chief economic advisor, and two current executives are bundling for him. bundlers are mega-fundraisers who critics say get special access. another big (candidate last) bundler is citicorp's michael froman. (candidate last)'s even tapped him to help put together his new administration. (candidate last)'s tripled (candidate last)'s hall from lehman brothers interest. citigroup, morgan stanley and j.p. morgan chase --more, more, and lots more to (candidate last). an (candidate last) spokesman told us they followed all federal rules and have gone above and beyond transparency requirements." </p><p><b>(candidate full):</b> "the real question is, will our country be better off four years from now?" </p><p><b>attkisson:</b> "the election is still undecided, but the money race, it's not even close. sharyl attkisson, cbs news, washington." </p><p><b><i><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86rap_iuhoq">watch</a> the report</i></b></p></span>
