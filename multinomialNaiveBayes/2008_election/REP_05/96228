(candidate last): "well, what i meant was that when this issue came up, not driver's license but comprehensive immigration reform generally, i worked with ted kennedy, i worked with dick durbin, i worked with (candidate full) - although he may not admit it now - (laughter) - to move this issue forward aggressively."
