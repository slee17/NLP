(candidate last) i think is not sure. where do you come out on that?" </p><p><b>governor (candidate full):</b> "(candidate full)'s right on that one. the line-item veto is the best tool the president has to reign in excessive spending, and mayor (candidate last) has a great record of cutting taxes and cutting spending, although, according to the mayor, mayor bloomberg, that followed him, he said that he left excessive deficits for him. but he's cut spending, he cut taxes, i cut spending, i cut taxes. but the real difference between us is that when it came to the line-item veto, i'm in favor of it. i used it 844 times, and he went all the way to the supreme court to take it away from the president, and it was not about a constitutional issue as he said, it was about getting more money for new york city. that's the very reason a line-item veto should be there, is to take away the kind of special deals that certain cities get." </p><p><em>to watch governor (candidate last), please see</em>: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwenq8ar-bw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwenq8ar-bw</a></p></span>
