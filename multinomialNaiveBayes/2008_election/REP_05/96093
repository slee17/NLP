make the cost of doing business low, you invest in technology and education, you let the american people have the incentives to innovate and create new industry. that's why america is so successful."</em> â€“ governor (candidate last) (cnbc's "kudlow &amp; company," 2/7/07)</b> </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #1: making the bush tax cuts permanent: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will make the bush tax cuts permanent.</b> governor (candidate last) believes making the bush tax cuts permanent is the first step to ensuring that americans are able to keep more of their hard-earned money. </p><p><b>by making the bush tax cuts permanent, governor (candidate last) will preserve tax relief for millions of americans:</b> </p><p><b>- 108,950,000 total taxpayers benefited from the tax relief in 2006. <br/> - 97,024,000 americans benefited from the rate reduction in the lowest tax bracket in 2006. <br/> - 34,080,000 couples saw a reduction in the marriage penalty in 2006. <br/> - 27,975,000 taxpayers benefited from the increased child credit in 2006.</b> </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #2: rolling back tax rates for all americans:</u> </b> </p><p><b>governor (candidate last) will roll back tax rates across the board for all americans.</b> as president, governor (candidate last) will cut marginal tax rates across the board, allowing all americans to save more money. this approach is fair, simple and extends the pro-growth benefits of tax rate cuts to all americans. </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #3: eliminating taxes on middle class savings: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will make middle class savings tax free.</b> governor (candidate last)'s plan will allow middle class americans to save tax free by changing the tax rate on interest, capital gains and dividends to absolutely 0%. by helping more americans save and invest, we can meet the challenges of an aging population and ensure the financial security of america. </p><p>- <b>governor (candidate last)'s plan will allow over 95% of american families to save and invest tax-free.</b> any taxpayer with adjusted gross income of under $200,000 would pay a tax rate of absolutely 0% on all of the income they earn from their savings, capital gains and dividends. </p><p><b>governor (candidate last)'s plan will help millions of taxpayers save and invest tax-free. based on 2005 tax returns: <br/></b> <br/> <b>- 56,148,740 taxpayers who earned interest could have benefited from this tax break. <br/> - 28,351,341 taxpayers who earned dividends could have benefited from this tax break. <br/> - 23,316,273 taxpayers who earned capital gains could have benefited from this tax break.</b> </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #4: eliminating the death tax once and for all: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will kill the death tax.</b> it is unfair to tax the american people three times: once when they earn their money; second when they invest it and receive income from those investments; and third when they die. </p><p>- <b>governor (candidate last) believes the death tax is fundamentally unfair.</b> the death tax unfairly impacts families, farmers, ranchers and small businesses. these are the engines of america's economic growth and they should not be burdened by unfair taxes. by eliminating the death tax, we will help thousands of americans take money that would be used to pay an unfair tax and instead use it fuel economic growth. </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #5: cutting the corporate tax rate: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) believes our corporate tax rate must be competitive with the rest of the world.</b> the united states has the second highest corporate tax rate in the organization for economic co-operation and development. we simply cannot afford for future economic growth to have a tax rate that is out of alignment with the other major economies of the world. </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #6: opposing social security tax increases: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) opposes any increase in social security taxes.</b> we can strengthen social security without resorting to higher social security taxes that will impact all americans. governor (candidate last) will oppose any proposed increase in social security taxes. </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #7: making medical expenses tax deductible: </u></b></p><p> governor (candidate last) will make qualified medical expenses tax deductible. governor (candidate last) supports the full deductibility of qualified medical expenses, which will allow americans to deduct the cost of their health insurance and out-of-pocket medical expenses, where accompanied by at least catastrophic insurance. </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #8: vetoing appropriations that exceed spending targets: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will veto appropriations bills that exceed spending targets.</b> he will veto any non-defense appropriations bill that grows spending at a rate greater than inflation minus one percent (cpi-1%). this should be considered the minimum amount of spending reductions. this will save $300 billion over 10 years. </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #9: reevaluating all federal spending programs:</u> </b> </p><p><b>governor (candidate last) will lead an effort to review and reevaluate all federal spending programs.</b> his administration will undertake an exhaustive review of each individual federal program with the goal to eliminate and consolidate programs that are no longer useful or are bureaucratic and unwieldy. federal spending programs do not have a right to immortality, and should not enjoy automatic increases year after year. </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #10: giving the president the line-item veto power:</u> </b> </p><p><b>governor (candidate last) believes the president needs the line-item veto power.</b> as governor, he had line-item authority, and often used it to trim or eliminate individual appropriations. giving the president this power would allow us to make tremendous strides in eliminating earmarks and cutting inefficient programs. </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #11: reforming entitlements:</u> </b> </p><p><b>governor (candidate last) will work to reform entitlement programs.</b> in a forthright and bipartisan manner, as president, governor (candidate last) will work with congress to address the looming budget crisis caused by increased entitlement spending. </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #12: restoring the supermajority requirement: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) has called on congress to re-impose a three-fifths (60%) supermajority requirement to raise taxes.</b> while governor (candidate last) is committed to lowering taxes, and as president will fight any proposed tax increase, he recognizes that all steps must be taken to prevent tax hikes. congress should not be able to increase taxes on a political whim and with a simple majority. </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #13: giving the president additional flexibility to cut taxes: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) proposes giving the executive branch the authority to spend up to 25% less than congress appropriates.</b> governor (candidate last) believes the president has an important role to play in the budget process, but that presidential authority has been unjustifiably curbed in recent decades. with the proliferation of earmarks and with congress unwilling to make tough spending choices, it is clear we need to re-insert the president into the budget process. the amount of money congress tells the president to spend should be a spending ceiling, not a final price tag. </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #14: reforming the tort system at the national level: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will implement national tort reform.</b> governor (candidate last) believes we must enact common sense tort reform at the federal level to make the system fairer and more predictable for both companies and the general public. these reforms will allow our companies to grow, while at the same time protecting those who deserve compensation for legitimate losses. </p><p><b>- governor (candidate last) will limit non-economic damages and prevent excessive punitive damages award.</b> non-economic damages are inherently speculative, and a reasonable statutory cap makes sense. governor (candidate last) also believes we need a statutory prohibition on outrageous punitive damage awards. </p><p>- <b>governor (candidate last) will require more disclosure in contingency fee arrangements.</b> more disclosure will help clients make informed decisions, and it will help end abusive lawsuits and extortionate settlement demands by plaintiffs' lawyers. </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #15: providing regulatory relief: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will provide employers with regulatory relief.</b> governor (candidate last) believes the washington regulatory burden is too high. as president, governor (candidate last) will eliminate cumbersome and unnecessary regulations and bureaucracies that hinder economic growth and job creation. too often washington politicians do not consider the negative economic effects of the many regulatory weeds that choke off growth. one of these regulations that must be pruned is sarbanes-oxley. </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #16: becoming energy secure: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will work to make america energy independent.</b> energy costs that put pressure on household finances are a major concern for families. with nearly 60 percent of our oil coming from abroad, we must become energy independent. governor (candidate last) has called for a bold and far-reaching research initiative to create new, economic sources of clean energy. we must invest in renewable and alternative fuels such as ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, biodiesel, and liquefied coal. </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #17: improving america's health care system:</u> </b> </p><p><b>governor (candidate last) will improve our health care system by putting conservative, market-based principles to work.</b> governor (candidate last)'s health care reform plan is a comprehensive solution to america's health care ills that expands access to affordable, portable, quality, private health insurance. rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all, government-run system, governor (candidate last)'s plan recognizes the importance of the role of the states in leading reform and the need for innovation in dealing with rising health care costs and the problem of the uninsured. </p><p>- <b>governor (candidate last)'s plan facilitates the growth of the private health insurance market.</b> governor (candidate last) believes that by expanding and deregulating the private health insurance market, we can decrease costs and ensure that more americans have access to affordable, portable, quality, private health insurance. </p><p><b>- step 1: establish federal incentives to deregulate and reform state health insurance markets so market forces can work. </b></p><p>- step 2: redirect federal spending on "free care" to help the low-income uninsured purchase private insurance. </p><p>- step 3: institute health savings account (hsa) enhancements and the full deductibility of qualified medical expenses. </p><p>- step 4: promote innovation in medicaid. </p><p>- step 5: implement medical liability reform. </p><p>- step 6: bring market dynamics and modern technology to health care. <br/> <br/> <b> <u>blueprint #18: promoting free trade: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) believes the united states must continue to work to open markets to american products.</b> governor (candidate last) is a strong believer in free trade and opening foreign markets to american products. while continuing to promote free trade, governor (candidate last) will also work to ensure that free trade is fair and there is a level-playing field for american products. </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #19: taking on the issue of embedded taxes: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will address the issue of embedded taxes on american products.</b> in the global economy, american products carry a very heavy load known as embedded taxes. it's estimated that our products face about a $100 billion disadvantage around the world. because of a wto ruling, taxes that are embedded in americans products cannot be refunded to exporters. as president, governor (candidate last) will fight for a level playing field for american products around the world. </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #20: strengthening our education system: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will strengthen our education system to prepare america's children for a new generation of challenges.</b> as president, governor (candidate last) will emphasize math and science education, while promoting innovative approaches such as charter schools and public-private partnerships, to ensure that our workers have the intellectual capital and skills to compete in the 21st century economy. we should raise the bar in education by setting high standards for our schools, insisting on accountability, and treating teaching as a true profession. </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #21: improving worker retraining: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) supports efforts to give workers the skills and tools necessary to succeed in the global economy.</b> he supports consolidating and streamlining the numerous existing federal worker training and retraining programs. </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #22: reforming our immigration laws and securing our borders: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will secure our borders and enforce our current immigration laws.</b> governor (candidate last) believes we must enforce our laws, secure our border, put in place an enforceable employment verification system, and provide no special pathway to citizenship for those here illegally. we must also encourage legal immigration and streamline the system to recruit and retain high-skilled workers and welcome the best and the brightest from around the world to our universities. </p><p><b> <u>blueprint #23: investing in our transportation infrastructure: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will invest in building and repairing the nation's transportation infrastructure.</b> we need to invest in infrastructure projects critical to the national economy and the flow of goods and people, instead of funding home-district pork. </p><p><b> <u>read governor (candidate last)'s full <em>strategy for a stronger america</em>:</u> </b> </p><p>to read more about governor
