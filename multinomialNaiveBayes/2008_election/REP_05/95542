<span class="displaytext"><b>for immediate release <br/> contact:</b> kevin madden (857) 288-6390 <p><b>boston, ma â€“</b> today, governor (candidate full) issued the following statement regarding senator (candidate full)'s (d-ny) refusal to denounce president ahmadinejad's visit to columbia university: </p><p>"senator (candidate last)'s refusal to denounce columbia university for inviting ahmadinejad to speak demonstrates a fundamental failure of leadership. under ahmadinejad, the iranian regime has spoken openly about the destruction of israel, has financed terrorism around the world and defied the international community as it pursues nuclear weapons. as ahmadinejad comes to the united states, now is the time to demonstrate resolve and not vacillate as senator (candidate last) has done today." </p><p><b> <u>background:</u> </b> </p><p><b>on "fox news sunday," sen. (candidate last) refused to speak out about iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad visiting columbia university.</b> fox news' chris wallace: "senator, we've got about 30 seconds left. one final question: you spoke out very clearly when iranian president ahmadinejad talked about going to ground zero. now he's going to speak at columbia tomorrow. do you think that columbia should rescind that invitation?" sen. (candidate last): "well, i'm going to leave that up to columbia, but i was outraged that he wanted to go to ground zero and did speak out very forcefully and thankfully he will not go to ground zero. obviously, we have a very difficult problem ahead in dealing with iran, something that i think the bush administration put on the backburner for too long, outsourced to the french, the british and the germans instead of going forward and seeing if there were any ways that we could reign in this regime and certainly prevent it from obtaining nuclear weapons. that's going to be my focus as a senator and as president."
