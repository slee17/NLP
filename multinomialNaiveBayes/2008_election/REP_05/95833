<span class="displaytext"><b>"(candidate last) best pick for state (PARTY NAME)s" <br/> <em>las vegas review-journal</em> <br/> editorial <br/> january 17, 2008</b> <p>... </p><p>"(PARTY NAME)s haven't had much national electoral success of late, and for that they have only themselves to blame. in the 14 years since the gingrich revolution, too many (PARTY NAME)s have embraced the beltway culture and abandoned the very principles upon which their success with voters depended – smaller government, low taxes, free markets and personal liberty. </p><p>"nevada (PARTY NAME)s on saturday should examine their choices through precisely such a filter. each gop candidate can make – and has made – a reasonable case that he's best suited to ensure the party again embraces the ideas and concepts that made this nation a beacon of freedom and economic opportunity. but in our opinion, the viable candidate most likely to lead (PARTY NAME)s in such a direction is (candidate full), the former governor of massachusetts. </p><p>"mr. (candidate last)'s economic agenda includes several pro-growth policies, including a plan to eliminate taxes on capital gains, interest and dividends for any household earning less than $200,000 a year. he backs a line-item veto, favors making the bush tax cuts permanent and understands that imposing higher taxes as a means of fixing social security will only make the problem worse. </p><p>"he's supportive of free trade, rejects protectionism, backs tort reform, supports school choice and accountability, and while governor was even able to successfully push a handful of spending reforms through massachusetts' overwhelmingly (PARTY NAME) legislature. mr. (candidate last) vows to exercise his veto power if congress doesn't embrace spending restraint and understands the drag that excessive federal regulation imposes on the innovation and the economy." </p><p>... </p><p>"mr. (candidate last) has extensive experience in the private sector, which is unusual for far too many politicians. before becoming governor of massachusetts, he was the president and ceo of the salt lake city olympic organizing committee. he is a former vice president and ceo of bain &amp; company inc., a boston management consulting firm, and also a founder of bain capital, a private equity firm." </p><p>... </p><p>"we urge nevada (PARTY NAME)s on saturday to support (candidate full)." </p><p><em>to read the full endorsement, please see:</em> <a href="http://www.lvrj.com/opinion/13860907.html">http://www.lvrj.com/opinion/13860907.html</a></p></span>
