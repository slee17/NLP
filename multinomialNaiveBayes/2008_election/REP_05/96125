<span class="displaytext"><b>for immediate release<br/>contact:</b> (candidate last) press shop (857) 288-6390 <p align="center"> <b>strategy for a stronger america:<br/>strengthening families</b> </p><p><b> <u>governor (candidate last)'s 12-point conservative plan to strengthen and empower american families: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>today, at the family research council, governor (candidate full) will outline a 12-point conservative plan to strengthen families in america.</b> there is much our nation can do to assist and validate parents in their vital role because families are the building blocks of america. our future as a nation is determined not just by heads of state but also by heads of households. as president, governor (candidate last) will ensure that washington stands alongside parents building stronger families. </p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px"> <p>- <b>governor (candidate last) believes our nation is stronger when we have stronger families.</b> the source of most of society's social problems can be traced to a breakdown of the family. our society is wealthier, healthier and stronger when it has strong families. it is the strength of this nation's families that ultimately determines america's strength in the family of nations. </p></blockquote> <p><b> <u>action #1: convening a white house summit on strengthening families: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will convene a white house summit on strengthening families.</b> as president, governor (candidate last) will act to strengthen the family, particularly in the inner cities of america. this white house summit will be a springboard to develop new initiatives to strengthen families. </p><p><b> <u>action #2: realigning government incentives to encourage marriage: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will realign government incentives to encourage marriage, not penalize it.</b> today, a single mother with child care who marries the father of her child can lose as much as $6,000 a year in government benefits. their combined incomes can disqualify them for medicaid, housing vouchers, food stamps, and welfare. it is time to make fathers responsible for their child's health and care. furthermore, we need to end the tax penalty on married couples. </p><p><b> <u>action #3: reinstating the family impact statement: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will reinstate the family impact statement.</b> in an effort to keep government from doing things that hurt and weaken families in america, president ronald reagan issued an executive order establishing a requirement that new government policies and programs be subject to the family impact statement. however, this executive order was rescinded by president (candidate last). as president, governor (candidate last) will reinstate the family impact statement and initiate an audit of all current programs and policies which may negatively impact families. </p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px"> <p>- <b>governor (candidate last) will support the rights of parents who are not always consulted about decisions affecting their children.</b> the work of being a parent is hard enough without the government making it harder. </p></blockquote> <p><b> <u>action #4: championing a federal marriage amendment: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will champion a federal marriage amendment to protect marriage as the union of a man and a woman.</b> in massachusetts, governor (candidate last) fought to promote traditional marriage after the massachusetts supreme judicial court legalized same-sex marriage. governor (candidate last) believes marriage is primarily about the development and nurturing of children. every child deserves a mother and a father. governor (candidate last) is the only major (PARTY NAME) candidate who supports a federal amendment because it is the only way to truly protect marriage. </p><p><b> <u>action #5: promoting a culture of life: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will be a pro-life president.</b> governor (candidate last) will appoint and fight for judges who follow the law and constitution, who understand judicial restraint and will not legislate from the bench. as president, governor (candidate last) will promote pro-life polices. he will oppose taxpayer-funded abortion, partial-birth abortion, abortion in military clinics and funding of abortion in international aid programs. he will work to ban embryonic cloning. he will work to increase adoptions by making the adoption tax credit permanent and raising awareness about embryonic adoption, or snowflake babies. </p><p><b> <u>action #6: fighting internet pornography: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will fight the modern plague of internet pornography, especially as it impacts our youth.</b> we must clean up the culture that surrounds our children. computer pornography has given new meaning to the words "home invasion." as president, governor (candidate last) will work to ensure that every home computer has an easy to engage pornography filter so that parents can protect their children. predators who use the internet to sexually assault children will be subject to a new "one strike, you're ours" law of imposing long prison sentences followed by lifetime gps tracking. </p><p><b> <u>action #7: taking the campaign against drugs to a new level: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will take the campaign against drugs to a new level.</b> we can do a better job educating our kids on the perils of drug use. parents may be the best anti-drug there is. a study last month showed that young children who come from homes where families had dinner together five times a week or more were 1/6th as likely to have used drugs. </p><p><b> <u>action #8: ensuring that every family has health insurance: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will ensure that every family has health insurance.</b> using proven, free-market principles, governor (candidate last)'s plan will ensure every citizen has health insurance, without new taxes, a government-run hillarycare style system or socialized medicine. governor (candidate last) put these conservative principles to work in massachusetts and the number of uninsured has been cut in half. </p><p><b> <u>action #9: improving education for our children: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will work to better schools and better education for our children.</b> governor (candidate last) believes in school choice and that every child should have an equal opportunity to have a good education. he supported school choice and fought for charter schools in massachusetts, and he will do the same thing in washington. </p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px"> <p>- <b>for parents home schooling their children, governor (candidate last) proposes a federal tax credit to help defray the cost of home-schooling expenses.</b> </p></blockquote> <p><b> <u>action #10: helping parents save for their children's college education: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will help parents save for their children's future college education.</b> he has proposed a middle-class tax-free savings program for every family earning $200,000 a year or less. under his plan, their tax rate on interest, dividends and capital gains will be absolutely zero. </p><p><b> <u>action #11: defending america's religious heritage: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will defend america's religious heritage.</b> as president, governor (candidate last) will ensure that his attorney general defends the free exercise of religion. the united states is a nation under god and should remain that way. </p><p><b> <u>action #12: leading by example:</u> </b> </p><p><b>as president, governor (candidate last) will lead by example.</b> the first family represents america to the world and represents america to our children and grandchildren. as president, governor (candidate last)'s family will live up to a higher standard and always try to make the american people proud. </p><p><b> <u>read governor (candidate last)'s full <em>strategy for a stronger america</em>:</u> </b> </p><p>to read more about governor
