<span class="displaytext"><b>for immediate release<br/>contact:</b> kevin madden (857) 288-6390 <p><b>boston, ma</b> – today, governor (candidate full) issued the following statement regarding last night's (PARTY NAME) presidential debate and senator (candidate full) (d-ny) on national security: </p><p>"once again, senator (candidate last) has demonstrated a fundamental weakness when it comes to our country's national security. when presented with a national security scenario at last night's debate, she vacillated and stated clearly that she would not give our men and women the tools they need to gain critical information. as president, i believe that when it comes to saving american lives we should and must use enhanced interrogation techniques." </p><p><b> <u>background: <br/></u> </b> <br/>- <b>at last night's (PARTY NAME) debate, senator (candidate last) said she would not give our men and women the tools they need to prevent an attack.</b> russert: "senator (candidate last), this is the number three man in al qaida. we know there's a bomb about to go off, and we have three days, and we know this guy knows where it is. should there be a presidential exception to allow torture in that kind of situation?" (candidate last): "you know, tim, i agree with what joe and barack have said. as a matter of policy it cannot be american policy period. i met with those same three- and four-star retired generals, and their principal point – in addition to the values that are so important for our country to exhibit – is that there is very little evidence that it works. now, there are a lot of other things that we need to be doing that i wish we were: better intelligence; making, you know, our country better respected around the world; working to have more allies. but these hypotheticals are very dangerous because they open a great big hole in what should be an attitude that our country and our president takes toward the appropriate treatment of everyone. and i think it's dangerous to go down this path."
