<span class="displaytext"><b>governor (candidate full) <br/> remarks at americans for prosperity "defending the american dream" summit <br/> washington, d.c. <br/> october 5, 2007</b> <p><b> <u>governor (candidate last) on his conservative blueprint to lower taxes:</u> </b> </p><p><b>governor (candidate last):</b> "let me tell you where i stand on taxes. first, i want to kill the death tax once and for all." (applause) </p><p>"and i want to make the bush tax cuts permanent." (applause) </p><p>"i want to lower marginal tax rates for all americans." (applause) </p><p>"now, which of these you get depends on how loud you clap for each one, so pay attention." (laughter) </p><p>"i want to hold the line on social security taxes." (applause) </p><p>"i want to stop the inflation creep of the alternative minimum tax." (applause) </p><p>"and i want to lower, yes lower, corporate taxes." (applause) </p><p>"if you want to see more jobs and better wages and more government revenue, then the idea is to get corporate taxes down. ours are the highest in the industrialized world, right there next to japan, some people say we're ahead, some say we're slightly below. but one thing is clear, look at japan's anemic growth. that's not what we want. </p><p>"so lower corporate taxes. and then finally one more thing, i say on the campaign trail, it's not fair that we get taxed when we earn our money, taxed when we save our money, and taxed when we die. and i've already talked about the death tax, let me talk about savings. under my plan for modest income and middle income american families, $200,000 dollars in income a year and less, there should be a new tax rate on savings. and the tax rate on interest, dividends, and capital gains should be absolutely zero!" (applause) </p><p>"now, i'm proud to be the only leading gop candidate or (PARTY NAME) candidate for that matter that has signed the tax pledge from the americans for tax reform that's something grover norquist put together." (applause) </p><p>"yeah, it is a big deal, in a race like this with so many people saying they're for lowering taxes, i wanted to get out there and make sure people heard me loud and clear." </p><p><em>to watch governor (candidate last)'s remarks, please see:</em> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjwyymhpopk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjwyymhpopk</a> </p><p><em>to read more about governor (candidate last)'s conservative blueprint to lower taxes,</em> <a href="http://(candidate full).com/news/press-releases/policy_briefing_blueprint_to_lower_taxes"> <em>please click here</em> </a> <em>.</em> </p><p><b> <u>governor (candidate last) on his conservative blueprint to lower spending: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last):</b> "i'm committed to lowering taxes, and i'm just as committed to lowering spending." (applause) </p><p>"unfortunately, increased spending on government programs has become the standard by which congress measures their commitment to solving a problem. they bought into this idea that those who are promoting a culture of dependency are selling and that is that spending is the measure of how much you care. i used to try that on my parents at christmas time – didn't work." (laughter) </p><p>"i've made a pledge to the american people and i'll repeat it here tonight: if congress sends me appropriations bills which exceed inflation less one percent, i'll veto those bills." (applause) </p><p>"and if congress doesn't have the stomach to do the cutting themselves, then give me the line-item veto that other governors have, because i like to veto by the way. i did a lot of that. i sort of miss vetoing. actually, as governor, i vetoed line-items 844 times. i can't wait to do that in washington." (applause) </p><p>"now, you may have seen or perhaps heard about my ad about (PARTY NAME) spending. when we had both branches in the government – both the legislative and executive branch – we sometimes didn't act much like (PARTY NAME)s. we spent too much, we earmarked too much and our ethical standards became the punch line for jay leno. when (PARTY NAME)s act like (PARTY NAME), america loses. it's time for (PARTY NAME)s to act like (PARTY NAME)s."
