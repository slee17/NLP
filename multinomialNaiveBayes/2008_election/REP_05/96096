</b> <br/> <b>today, in iowa, governor (candidate full) discussed his plan to enforce our immigration laws and reform our immigration system.</b> america's immigration system is broken. governor (candidate last) believes we must enforce and reform our immigration laws so that we can end illegal immigration. america will always welcome legal immigration, but as a nation we also insist on the rule of law. to reform our immigration system and enhance america's national security, governor (candidate last) will: </p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px"> <p>- <b>secure the border.</b> governor (candidate last) will follow through on the congressional commitment to build a physical and technological fence along the southern border, and secure other points of entry throughout the country. he will also increase border control enforcement and resources. </p><p>- <b>implement a mandatory and enforceable employment verification system.</b> governor (candidate last) will issue a biometrically-enabled and tamperproof card to non-citizens and create a national database so employers can easily verify the legal status of non-citizens in this country. </p><p>- <b>hold employers accountable.</b> governor (candidate last) will make it easier for employers to verify legal status and work authorization of non-citizens through a federal database. employers will be held accountable if they hire illegal immigrants with stiffer fines and penalties. </p><p>- <b>reject amnesty.</b> governor (candidate last) opposes amnesty or any special path to citizenship for those here illegally. he opposed each version of the (candidate last)-kennedy legislation as the wrong approach and a form of amnesty. amnesty did not work 20 years ago, and it will not work today. </p><p>- <b>end the magnet of "sanctuary cities."</b> governor (candidate last) will cut back federal funding to cities that are "sanctuaries" for illegal immigrants and who refuse to comply with federal law or aid federal law enforcement. sanctuary cities tell those who are here illegally that the laws of this country do not matter and become magnets for illegal immigration. </p><p>- <b>oppose any special benefits for illegal immigrants.</b> governor (candidate last) opposes giving driver's licenses or in-state tuition to those here illegally. he believes states should not provide those types of incentives. as president, he will cut back federal funding to states that do so. </p><p>- <b>promote state and local partnerships with federal immigration officials.</b> governor (candidate last) believes more state and local authorities should work with the federal government to enforce immigration laws. this builds off of his experience in massachusetts where he deputized the state police to work with u.s. immigration and customs enforcement (ice) and enforce federal immigration laws. </p><p>- <b>improve interior enforcement.</b> governor (candidate last) will provide additional resources to enforce existing immigration laws throughout the nation. we cannot be serious about our immigration laws until we provide the resources needed to enforce them. governor (candidate last) supports the administration's steps to strengthen the enforcement of our current immigration laws. </p><p>- <b>teach english in our schools.</b> governor (candidate last) believes we must teach english in our classrooms because to be successful you have to speak the language of america. </p><p>- <b>end chain migration.</b> governor (candidate last) believes we should end the policy of chain migration that says if a child is born here to illegal immigrants then, by right, the entire family is brought in based upon that child's citizenship. as a nation we can limit family sponsorships while at the same time promote legitimate family reunification. </p><p>- <b>encourage legal immigration.</b> governor (candidate last) will streamline the visa system to recruit and retain skilled workers in high demand by u.s. companies. he will also welcome the best and the brightest from around the world to our universities. we must stop illegal immigration so we can encourage legal immigration.
