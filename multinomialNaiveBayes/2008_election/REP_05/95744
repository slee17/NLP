<span class="displaytext"><b>for immediate release <br/> contact:</b> kevin madden (857) 288-6390 <p><b>boston, ma -</b> governor (candidate full) issued the following statement on today's u.s. senate agreement on immigration reform: </p><p>"i strongly oppose today's bill going through the senate. it is the wrong approach. any legislation that allows illegal immigrants to stay in the country indefinitely, as the new 'z-visa' does, is a form of amnesty. that is unfair to the millions of people who have applied to legally immigrate to the u.s. </p><p>"today's senate agreement falls short of the actions needed to both solve our country's illegal immigration problem and also strengthen our legal immigration system. border security and a reliable employment verification system must be our first priority."</p></span>
