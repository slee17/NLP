<span class="displaytext"><b>"(candidate last) for president" <br/> <em>national review <br/></em> by the editors <br/> december 11, 2007</b> <p>... </p><p>"our guiding principle has always been to select the most conservative viable candidate. in our judgment, that candidate is (candidate full), the former governor of massachusetts. unlike some other candidates in the race, (candidate last) is a full-spectrum conservative: a supporter of free-market economics and limited government, moral causes such as the right to life and the preservation of marriage, and a foreign policy based on the national interest. while he has not talked much about the importance of resisting ethnic balkanization – none of the major candidates has – he supports enforcing the immigration laws and opposes amnesty. those are important steps in the right direction." </p><p>... </p><p>"(candidate last) is an intelligent, articulate, and accomplished former businessman and governor. at a time when voters yearn for competence <br/>and have soured on washington because too often the bush administration has not demonstrated it, (candidate last) offers proven executive skill. he has demonstrated it in everything he has done in his professional life, and his tightly organized, disciplined campaign is no exception. he himself has shown impressive focus and energy. </p><p>"it is true that he has less foreign-policy experience than (candidate last) and (especially) (candidate last), but he has more executive experience than both. since almost all of the candidates have the same foreign-policy principles, what matters most is which candidate has the skills to execute that vision. </p><p>"like any (PARTY NAME), he would have an uphill climb next fall. but he would be able to offer a persuasive outsider's critique of washington. his conservative accomplishments as governor showed that he can work with, and resist, a (PARTY NAME) legislature. he knows that not every feature of the health-care plan he enacted in massachusetts should be replicated nationally, but he can also speak with more authority than any of the other (PARTY NAME) candidates about this pressing issue. he would also have credibility on the economy, given his success as a businessman and a manager of the olympics." </p><p>... </p><p>"we believe that (candidate last) is a natural ally of social conservatives. he speaks often about the toll of fatherlessness in this country. he may not have thought deeply about the political dimensions of social issues until, as governor, he was confronted with the cutting edge of social liberalism. no other (PARTY NAME) governor had to deal with both human cloning and court-imposed same-sex marriage. he was on the right side of both issues, and those battles seem to have made him see the stakes of a broad range of public-policy issues more clearly. he will work to put abortion on a path to extinction. whatever the process by which he got where he is on marriage, judges, and life, we're glad he is now on our side – and we trust him to stay there." </p><p>... </p><p>"(candidate last) is an exemplary family man and a patriot whose character matches the high office to which he aspires. </p><p>"more than the other primary candidates, (candidate last) has president bush's virtues and avoids his flaws. his moral positions, and his instincts on taxes and foreign policy, are the same. but he is less inclined to federal activism, less tolerant of overspending, better able to defend conservative positions in debate, and more likely to demand performance from his subordinates. a winning combination, by our lights. in this most fluid and unpredictable (PARTY NAME) field, we vote for (candidate full)." </p><p><em>to read the full endorsement, please <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ymmxytuyyza1ytk2yze5ngvmnjc0ogfjywjmnzmznji=&amp;p=1">click here</a>.</em></p></span>
