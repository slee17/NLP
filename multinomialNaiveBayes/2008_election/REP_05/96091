(candidate full), remarks at the family research council, washington, d.c., 10/19/07) </p><p><b> <u>governor (candidate last)'s conservative plan to strengthen and empower iowa families: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>today, in iowa, governor (candidate full) outlined his conservative plan to strengthen families in iowa.</b> there is much our nation can do to strengthen families because our future is determined not just by heads of state but also by heads of households. as president, governor (candidate last) will ensure that washington stands alongside parents in iowa who are building stronger families. </p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px"> <p>- <b>governor (candidate last) believes our nation and iowa are stronger when we have stronger families.</b> the source of most of society's social problems can be traced to a breakdown of the family. iowa is wealthier, healthier and stronger when it has strong families. it is the strength of our families in iowa and across the country that ultimately determines america's strength in the family of nations. </p></blockquote> <p><b> <u>wall #1: championing marriage: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate last) will champion a federal marriage amendment to protect marriage as the union of a man and a woman.</b> in massachusetts, governor (candidate last) fought to promote traditional marriage after the massachusetts supreme judicial court legalized same-sex marriage. the importance of defending marriage was made even more critical with the recent iowa court decision on same-sex marriage. governor (candidate last) believes marriage is primarily about the development and nurturing of children. every child deserves a mother and a father. </p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px"> <p>- <b>governor (candidate last) is the only major (PARTY NAME) candidate who supports a federal amendment because it is the only way to truly protect marriage. <br/></b> <br/>- <b>governor (candidate last) spoke out against the iowa court decision legalizing same-sex marriage.</b> "the ruling in iowa today is another example of an activist court and unelected judges trying to redefine marriage and disregard the will of the people as expressed through iowa's defense of marriage act. this once again highlights the need for a federal marriage amendment to protect the traditional definition of marriage as between one man and one woman."

child can lose as much as $6,000 a year in government benefits. their combined incomes can disqualify them for medicaid, housing vouchers, food stamps, and welfare. it is time to make fathers responsible for their child's health and care. furthermore, we need to end the tax penalty on married couples. </p><p><b> <u>wall #2: protecting our children: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor

last) will ensure that families in iowa have health insurance.</b> using proven, free-market principles, governor (candidate last)'s plan will ensure every citizen has health insurance, without new taxes, a government-run hillarycare style system or socialized medicine. more than 270,000 people, or nine percent of iowa's population, lacks health insurance. in massachusetts, governor (candidate
