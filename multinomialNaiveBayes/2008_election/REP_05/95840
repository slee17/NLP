(PARTY NAME)s respect and value legal immigration â€“ but illegal immigration, that is something we have got to stop. </p><p>"and i'm pretty proud of my record as the governor. i took every action i knew how to take to stop illegal immigration. i made sure illegals didn't get driver's licenses. i vetoed a bill that would have given illegals a tuition break in our state university system. i also empowered our state police to enforce federal immigration laws and, of course, i also insisted on english immersion in our schools. but, at the same time, i tried to help legal immigrants. so i pushed for additional funding for english as a second language, so legal immigrants could learn english, because i think to be successful in america you've got to speak the language of america." </p><p><b>scarborough:</b> "and you think (candidate full)'s record on immigration is a failed record?" </p><p><b>governor (candidate last):</b> "well, i think his record on immigration is a real problem for him, and so he's now talking about an entirely different tact that he'd take as president. but his record, i think makes it pretty clear where his heart stands on this. he fought to provide a tuition break, an in-state tuition break for illegals, and he also fought for scholarships for illegals. if you create benefits like that for the children of those who come here illegally, you basically are creating a magnet that draws people across the border or draws them to over stay their visas. that's the wrong thing for america. we need to enforce our laws and have a nation of laws. that's so essential to the nation, a nation of liberty and prosperity, to have laws and to have the rule of law that it's just actually axiomatic that you can't have people who are running states, or for that matter cities like new york city, that put in place sanctuary policies that encourage people to come here and not follow the law." </p><p><em>to watch governor (candidate last) discuss illegal immigration, please</em> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yojducm3_og"> <em>click here</em> </a> <em>.</em></p></span>
