<span class="displaytext"><b>for immediate release</b> <br/> <b>contact:</b> kevin madden (857) 288-6390 <p><b>boston, ma -</b> today, governor (candidate full) issued the following statement on senator (candidate full)'s cuba succession policy, outlined today in the miami herald: </p><p>"senator (candidate full) continues to demonstrate through his words that he does not have the strength to confront america's enemies or defend our values. first, senator (candidate last) said he would make it a priority to meet with castro in his first year in office. now, he's proposing that we begin to lift sanctions against the castro regime. unilateral concessions to a dictatorial regime are counterproductive, helping to secure a succession of power and repression instead of a transition to freedom. they will only embolden those who cling to power at the expense of the cuban people. we must not weaken our policy on cuba until the castro regime is dismantled, all political prisoners are freed and cuba transitions to free and fair elections."</p></span>
