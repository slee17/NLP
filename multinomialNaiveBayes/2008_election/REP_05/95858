president bush is a harvard mba, too." </p><p>governor (candidate last): "well, everybody has their own management style and their own approach and i respect enormously the approach other people. mine is just different. and if you read "cobra ii" and "assassins' gate" and "looming tower" and some of the reports of the events leading up not only to 9/11, but to the conflict itself, there's a sense that we really weren't ready for the post major conflict period. and that has resulted in a blossoming of the sectarian violence, of insurgents within the country and from without, and a setting which is a very troubled, difficult position." </p><p>stephanopoulos: "yet, you support the president's decision to send more troops right now." </p><p>governor (candidate last): "yeah." </p><p>stephanopoulos: "how much time do you give it to work?" </p><p>governor (candidate last): "well, it's not years. i think you're going to know within months." </p><p>stephanopoulos: "mayor (candidate last) said the other night he's not confident it's going to work. are you?" </p><p>governor (candidate last): "well, you know, i think it's hard to predict whether this troop surge will work, but i'm absolutely confident it's the right thing to do." </p><p><b> <u>governor (candidate full) on north korea: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <em>to view governor (candidate last) discussing the recent agreement with north korea, please see</em>: </p><p><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7326271421281225687">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7326271421281225687</a> </p><p>stephanopoulos: "the president announced a nuclear deal with north korea this week. is it a good deal?" </p><p>governor (candidate last): "well, i'm hopeful that the key to the deal, which is additional inspectors by iaea inspectors will let us determine whether or not they're cheating. because i think the experience that we've had with north korea is, just like the last time that president (candidate last) entered into an agreed framework, that the north koreans cheat." </p><p>stephanopoulos: "but because of that history, others like john bolton, the president's own former u.n. ambassador, say it's a bad deal. we're actually rewarding north korea for bad behavior when we know they cheated in the past." </p><p>governor (candidate last): "well, i want to see the final agreement. i want to see how the t's are crossed and the i's are dotted. i'm not going to tell you whether right now it's a good agreement, but i know what the problem is in the agreement, and that is unless the iaea has the kind of inspections that we can be sure they're not cheating, then it would not be a step forward, and that's going to be critical." </p><p><b> <u>governor (candidate full) on families:</u> </b> </p><p><em>to view governor (candidate last) discussing his pro-family values, please see</em>: </p><p><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8558358143535499493;">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8558358143535499493;</a> </p><p><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3448846850326676706">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3448846850326676706</a> </p><p>governor (candidate last): "at the national level, we should define marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman. and this isn't about adult rights. a lot of people get confused that gay marriage is about treating gay people the same as treating heterosexual people, and that's not the issue involved here. this is about the development and nurturing of children. marriage is primarily an institution to help develop children. and children's development, i believe, is greatly enhanced by access to a mom and a dad. i think every child deserves a mom and a dad, and that's why i'm so consistent and vehement in my view that we should have a federal amendment which defines marriage in that way." </p><p>... </p><p>stephanopoulos: "are you for it [gay adoption]?" </p><p>governor (candidate last): "and there are gay couples that are having children of their own, and, that's - obviously, that's their right. but my belief is that the idea setting for a child is where there's a mom and a dad." <a class="more" href="/img/generic/image4.jpg" target="_blank"></a></p></span>
