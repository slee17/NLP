<span class="displaytext"><b>for immediate release<br/>contact:</b> (candidate last) press shop (857) 288-6390 <p><b>boston, ma â€“</b> today, governor (candidate full) issued the following statement regarding guantanamo bay and today's supreme court arguments: </p><p>"today, the supreme court will once again hear arguments on the detention of captured terrorists being held at guantanamo bay. some people view guantanamo as a symbol of american aggression. i view it as a symbol of american resolve. </p><p>"our country is asking young men and women in our military and intelligence services, and their families, to sacrifice beyond all knowing to capture or kill radical jihadists before they plan and execute another attack on the united states. to win this fight, we must be able to detain and interrogate the terrorists they catch. </p><p>"the base at guantanamo is designed to hold and question enemy combatants who pose a threat to the nation or have intelligence value. closing and relocating the facility to the heartland of the united states, as some have suggested, would pose an undue risk to innocent americans and, as today's arguments demonstrate, could have profound legal implications. </p><p>"so long as it remains a vital tool to keep america safe, i will fight to keep guantanamo bay open."</p></span>
