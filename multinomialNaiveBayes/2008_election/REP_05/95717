<span class="displaytext"><i>by: governor (candidate full)<br/>townhall.com<br/>wednesday, apr 25</i><p>"as i have traveled the country in connection with my campaign for president, i have been inspired by the commitment of countless americans to shaping the future of america's political system. their commitment takes many different forms, from distributing literature, to attending a campaign rally, to contributing money to an individual candidate. i applaud this involvement, even if it is not supportive of my candidacy. an informed and active citizenry is vital to the long-term health of our political system." </p><p>... </p><p>"i have not spent a career in politics, but i know enough about the laws of this country, and the way washington works, to understand that the (candidate last)-feingold law is riddled with shortcomings. </p><p>"let's start with something basic: the american people should be free to advocate for their candidates and their positions without burdensome limitations." </p><p>... </p><p>"the american people should be able to exercise their first amendment rights without having to think about hiring a lawyer. but that is the direction in which we are headed. in 2004, the non-profit group wisconsin right to life wanted to run grassroots radio and television ads urging people in the state to contact their senators (which the ads mentioned by name) and ask them to oppose the ongoing filibusters of president bush's judicial nominees. a provision in (candidate last)-feingold, however, was used to argue that the ads were illegal. rendering a verdict on what constitutes acceptable political speech is something for voters – not judges – to decide." </p><p>... </p><p>"we step into dangerous territory when politicians start eviscerating our fundamental freedoms in the name of amorphous principles, like campaign finance reform. if i am elected president, a top priority will be to push for the repeal of this deeply-flawed measure, and restore the full freedom of political participation and expression to the american people." <a class="more" href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/mitt(candidate last)/2007/04/25/the_fundamental_flaws_in_the_(candidate last)-feingold_law" target="_blank">view entire article</a></p></span>
