'who is going to put teeth into these laws?' 'who is going to represent the will of the people on an important issue culturally, for our health care, for our prisons, for our economic structure, for everything that we care about this issue is involved?' and on this issue, i think (candidate last) has been a big loser. okay? that is my view on this."... </p><p><em>to listen to laura ingraham, please</em> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jns_smj9z1e"> <em>click here</em> </a> <em>.</em> </p><p><b> <u> <em>the wall street journal</em>'s brendan miniter: "(candidate last)'s tax challenge":</u> </b></p><p>"(candidate last)'s tax challenge" <br/> by brendan miniter <br/> <em>the</em> <em>wall street journal</em>'s opinion journal's "political diary" <br/> december 3, 2007 </p><p>"former arkansas gov. (candidate full) is good at one-liners." </p><p>... </p><p>"asked by a reporter what he thought about former sen. (candidate full)'s attack ad that shows an old news clip of mr. (candidate last) as governor before he lost 100 pounds listing one tax after another he would support raising, the governor got off one of his better lines: he said that he must have been under the influence of sugar at the time. </p><p>"it's a good line, but not good enough." </p><p>... </p><p>"he likes to point out that as governor he cut taxes some 90 times. what he doesn't say, however, is that he also raised more than 20 different taxes for a net tax hike during his tenure of about $500 million. he also left it to his successor – (PARTY NAME) gov. mike beebe – to cut the state's hated sales tax, which mr. beebe did shortly after taking office. </p><p>"when we pressed mr. (candidate last) on his tax record a few months ago, he said he 'won't apologize' for raising taxes because he needed the money to repair his state's decrepit highways. fresh asphalt always seems to appeal to (PARTY NAME) elected officials – especially those who love earmarking federal highway funds. but it's not something that will win over fiscal conservatives."... </p><p><b> <u> <em>san diego union-tribune</em>: "meet the huckster":</u> </b> </p><p><b>"meet the huckster" <br/> <em>san diego union-tribune</em> <br/> editorial <br/> december 3, 2007</b> </p><p>... </p><p>"unfortunately for (candidate last), the positive first impression he often makes fades when you learn more about him. he may have been a solid steward in his 14 years as lieutenant governor and governor in arkansas. but he also showed an enthusiasm for parlaying his public office into a cushy lifestyle that makes fabian nunez, california's similarly inclined assembly speaker, look like a boy scout. </p><p>"over the years, (candidate last) has: </p><p>"used campaign funds to pay himself $14,000 for being his own media consultant. </p><p>"used campaign funds to pay himself $43,000 for use of his private plane while attempting to hide what the payment was actually in return for. </p><p>"used an account set up to cover operational costs of the governor's mansion to pay such obviously personal expenses as fast-food and dry-cleaning bills. </p><p>"set up a nonprofit organization that paid him $23,500 without disclosing the source of the money. </p><p>"attempted to take $70,000 of furniture with him when moving out of the governor's mansion. </p><p>"took more than 130 gifts worth more than $300,000 – while suing to overturn a law that made him disclose the gifts. </p><p>"we could go on in this vein, but space is limited. the bottom line: (candidate full) has an awful lot of explaining to do."... </p><p><em>to read the full editorial, please</em> <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20071203/news_mz1ed3bottom.html"> <em>click here</em> </a> <em>.</em></p></span>
