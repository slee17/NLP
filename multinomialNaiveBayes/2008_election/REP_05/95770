<span class="displaytext"><b><em>"who's the biggest tax raiser?" <br/> <em>arkansas leader</em> <br/>by ernie dumas, editorial writer for the <em>leader</em> <br/>december 1, 2007 <p>"(candidate full) raised more taxes in 10 years in office than bill (candidate last) did in his 12 years." </p><p>... </p><p>"(candidate last) tax increases </p><p>- imposed an income tax surcharge of 3 percent on tax liabilities of individuals and domestic and foreign corporations (act 38, 1st special session of 2003). (it was temporary until revenues improved. the legislature repealed it in 2005.) </p><p>- increased the sales tax by 1/8 of one percent by initiated act (but it was a personal campaign by (candidate last), who campaigned across the state for it and took a celebrated bass boat trip for 4 days down the arkansas river holding press conferences in each river city to urge passage of the act) </p><p>- increased the sales tax by one-half of 1 percent (act 1492 of 1999) </p><p>- increased the sales tax by 7/8ths of 1 percent and expand the sales tax to many services previously exempt from the tax (act 107, 2nd special session of 2003) </p><p>- collected a 2 percent tax on chewing tobacco, cigars, package tobacco, cigarette papers and snuff (act 434 of 1997) </p><p>- levied an additional excise tax of 7 percent on tobacco (act 38 of 1st special session of 2003) </p><p>- increased the tax on cigarette and tobacco permits (act 1337 of 1997) </p><p>- increased the tax on cigarette and tobacco – cigarettes by $1.25 per thousand cigarettes and 2 percent of the manufacturers' selling price on tobacco products (act 434 of 1997) </p><p>- increased the tax on cigarettes by 25 cents a pack (act 38, 1st special session of 2003) </p><p>- levied a 3 percent excise tax on all retail sales of beer (act 1841 of 2001 and extended by act 272 of 2003 and act 2188 of 2005) </p><p>- revived the 4 percent mixed drink tax of 1989 and added a 4 percent tax on private clubs (act 1274 of 2005) </p><p>- increased the tax on gasoline by 3 cents a gallon (act 1028 of 1999) </p><p>- increased the tax on diesel by 4 cents a gallon (act 1028 of 1999) note: contrary to what (candidate last) has said repeatedly in debates, speeches and tv shows, the 1999 gasoline and diesel taxes were not submitted to the voters and approved by 80 per cent of them. </p><p>- increased the driver's license by $6 a person, from $14 to $20 (act 1500 of 2001) </p><p>... </p><p>"but if you look at the major taxes, i see the aggregate (candidate last) taxes as greater, especially if you deduct the 4 cent gasoline and diesel taxes that (candidate last) vetoed in 1985 and that the legislature enacted over his veto. </p><p>"anyway, the sales tax is the big revenue producer. both raised it by 1.5 cents on the dollar and both expanded it to cover a myriad of services. (candidate last) raised motor fuel taxes a little more, (candidate last) cigarette taxes a lot more. </p><p>"a further note: (candidate last) claims credit for a major tax cut in 1997, saying it was the first tax cut in arkansas history (there had been many prior to that) and that he forced the (PARTY NAME) legislature to curtail its impulse to always raise taxes. </p><p>"the facts: the omnibus income tax cut bill of 1997 was proposed by gov. jim guy tucker in the spring of 1996." </p><p>... </p><p>"the 94 tax cuts that he said he fathered are similarly misleading. the vast majority of those were the usual exemptions and modifications of various taxes and fees that the legislature enacts every time it meets." </p><p>... </p><p>"if you counted all the tax benefits extended to corporations under the incentives enacted by the legislature under (candidate last) – and they were part of his programs, especially in 1983, 1985 and 1989 – the tax cuts would dwarf those under (candidate last)." </p><p><em>to read the full editorial, please</em> <a href="http://72.32.175.87:8080/opencms/opencms/news/press-releases/www.arkansasleader.com/2007/11/editorialswhos-biggest-tax-raiser.html"> <em>click here</em> </a> <em>.</em></p></em></b></span>
