u.s. and multilateral efforts to stop currency manipulation by china and others; action against intellectual property rights theft; negotiations to open markets for services; and building food, safety and other standards to protect americans but stop illegitimate efforts to stop u.s. exports. </p><p><b>- launching a "reagan zone of economic freedom" among nations committed to high standards and enforcement:</b> we need bold ideas to address the new global economy. starting with a core of u.s. free trade agreement partners, governor (candidate last) would seek to bring together nations committed to open markets and playing by the rules in the largest ever free trade area, and go beyond traditional trade to promote high standards in areas critical to u.s. competitiveness. the reagan zone of economic freedom would act as an alliance working together internally, in the world trade organization and elsewhere to push reforms and work cooperatively in areas like labor and the environment. governor (candidate last) would seek to expand these efforts to include the european union and other nations that agree to meet these standards, while challenging china and others advancing agreements that exclude america. </p><p><b>providing presidential authority and experience to drive open markets for america:</b> </p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px"> <p><b>- america and the people of washington state must reject the (PARTY NAME)' policies of retreat from the world.</b> denying america the ability to negotiate to open markets while our competitors gain advantages is no strategy. rejecting negotiations to drive open markets will harm washington state's workers, farmers, companies and small businesses, as our competitors move forward. </p><p><b>- the president needs trade promotion authority (tpa) to open markets for america.</b> we cannot afford to fall behind as china and others cut deals that hurt american exports and jobs. there are already over 300 agreements in the world that do not include the united states and place u.s. exports at a disadvantage. </p><p><b>- this authority needs to be matched with a president who has the business experience to understand how america can win in the global economy and push tough negotiations.</b> governor (candidate last) will ensure that we maintain the ability to defend our homeland security while expanding legitimate trade and concluding and thoroughly enforcing deals that benefit america. </p></blockquote> <p><b>training, assisting, and empowering america's workers to succeed in the new economy:</b> governor (candidate last) believes in giving american and washington state workers the tools they need to succeed and prosper in the new economy. to accomplish this goal, governor (candidate last) will: </p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px"> <p><b>- create worker empowerment and training accounts.</b> these self-managed accounts will give workers the opportunity to take control of their own futures by getting the training and education they need to succeed in the new economy. the accounts may be used for a broad variety of different training and educational opportunities, including those provided by community colleges or businesses that hire these workers. best of all, these accounts will take money out of the hands of bureaucrats and put it into the hands of those who really need it â€“ displaced workers. </p><p><b>- streamline and enhance access to worker training and educational programs.</b> governor (candidate last) will initiate an audit of all existing worker training and educational programs to ensure that workers are being helped most efficiently, while eliminating duplicative spending and minimizing bureaucratic overhead. he will also create true "one-stop-shops" that make it easier for workers to get access to the benefits, training, and educational opportunities they need to find jobs in the new economy. </p></blockquote></span>
