(candidate last) was more successful when he took on the state legislature for imposing a retroactive tax on capital gains earnings. after a bloody fight, (candidate last) succeeded in passing a bill preventing the capital gains tax from being applied retroactively, resulting in a rebate of $275 million for capital gains taxes collected in 2002. governor (candidate last) also signed legislation that provided property tax relief to seniors and legislation establishing a two-day tax-free shopping holiday in 2005."
