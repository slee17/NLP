<span class="displaytext"><b>for immediate release <br/> contact:</b> kevin madden (857) 288-6390 <p align="center"> <b>governor (candidate last) proposes "reagan zone of economic freedom"</b> </p><p><b>today, in south carolina, governor (candidate last) addressed his vision for opening markets for america.</b> ensuring that america is the strongest, most competitive economy in the world depends both on leading change domestically and opening international markets for america. </p><p><b>- opening markets is key to u.s. prosperity.</b> the (PARTY NAME) vision of opening markets brought unprecedented prosperity to america and the world. eliminating trade barriers could increase u.s. annual incomes by $500 billion, roughly $4,500 per household – a potentially greater impact than any other policy change. real u.s. annual incomes are already $1 trillion higher, an average of $9,000 per household, due to increased trade since 1945. </p><p><b>- opening markets is pro-agriculture.</b> approximately one out of every three american acres are planted for export. reducing high agricultural barriers present a key opportunity for u.s. farmers. </p><p><b>- opening markets is pro-international development.</b> the world bank estimates that eliminating trade barriers could lift 66 million people out of poverty. raising africa's share of world trade from 2 to 3% would provide export revenues ($70 billion) nearly three times the amount that sub-saharan africa receives from global aid donors. </p><p><b>- opening markets is pro-american leadership in the world.</b> trade is among our most powerful tools for american engagement and leading change. for example, u.s. free trade partners in the arab world have renounced all aspects of the arab league boycott of israel. </p><p><b>- <a href="http://www.(candidate full).com/news/photo-albums/opening_markets">click here</a> to view governor (candidate last)'s powerpoint presentation.</b> </p><p><u> <b>governor (candidate last)'s vision for opening markets and helping american workers succeed:</b> <br/> </u> <br/> <b>launching a new agenda for opening markets including <u>a "reagan zone of economic freedom"</u> to fuel a new wave of global prosperity:</b> </p><p><b>- concluding existing negotiations, like the doha round, to benefit america.</b> the doha round and free trade agreements can be huge opportunities for america if we ensure no unilateral disarmament on agriculture and demand that they provide strong benefits for u.s. farmers and goods and services producers. </p><p><b>- expanding enforcement and new frontiers of u.s. competitiveness.</b> governor (candidate last)'s vision for expanding trade includes stronger: enforcement efforts abroad; u.s. and multilateral efforts to stop currency manipulation by china and others; action against intellectual property rights theft; negotiations to open markets for services that are the bulk of the u.s. economy; and building food, safety and other standards to protect americans but stop illegitimate efforts to stop u.s. farm and other exports. </p><p><b>- launching a "reagan zone of economic freedom" among nations committed to high standards and enforcement:</b> we need bold ideas to address the new global economy. starting with a core of u.s. free trade agreement partners, governor (candidate last) would seek to bring together nations committed to open markets and playing by the rules in the largest ever free trade area, and go beyond traditional trade to promote high standards in areas critical to u.s. competitiveness. the reagan zone of economic freedom would act as an alliance working together internally, in the world trade organization and elsewhere to push reforms and work cooperatively in areas like labor and the environment. governor (candidate last) would seek to expand these efforts to include the european union and other nations that agree to meet these standards, while challenging china and others advancing agreements that exclude america. </p><p><b>providing presidential authority and experience to drive open markets for america:</b> </p><p><b>- america must reject the (PARTY NAME)' policies of retreat from the world.</b> denying america the ability to negotiate to open markets while our competitors gain advantages is no strategy. rejecting the free trade agreement with colombia, one of america's strongest allies in the world, would further show they have no understanding of the new global economy and america's leadership role in our hemisphere and the world. </p><p><b>- the president needs trade promotion authority (tpa) to open markets for america.</b> we cannot afford to fall behind as china and others cuts deals that hurt american exports and jobs. there are already over 300 agreements in the world that do not include the united states and place u.s. exports at a disadvantage. </p><p><b>- this authority needs to be matched with a president that has the business experience to understand how america can win in the global economy and push tough negotiations.</b> governor (candidate last) will ensure that we maintain the ability to defend our homeland security while expanding legitimate trade and concluding and thoroughly enforcing deals that benefit america. </p><p><b>training, assisting, and empowering america's workers to succeed in the new economy:</b> governor (candidate last) believes in giving american workers the tools they need to succeed and prosper in the new economy. to accomplish this goal, governor (candidate last) will: </p><p><b>- streamline and enhance access to worker training and educational programs.</b> governor (candidate last) will initiate an audit of all existing worker training and educational programs to ensure that workers are being helped most efficiently, while eliminating duplicative spending and minimizing bureaucratic overhead. he will also create true "one-stop-shops" that make it easier for workers to get access to the benefits, training, and educational opportunities they need to find jobs in the new economy. </p><p><b>- create worker empowerment and training accounts.</b> these self-managed accounts will give workers the opportunity to take control of their own futures by getting the training and education they need to succeed in the new economy. the accounts may be used for a broad variety of different training and educational opportunities, including those provided by community colleges or businesses that hire these workers. best of all, these accounts will take money out of the hands of bureaucrats and put it into the hands of those who really need it – displaced workers.</p></span>
