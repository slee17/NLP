<span class="displaytext"><b> <u> <em>grand rapids press</em> endorses governor (candidate last):</u> </b> <p><b>"press editorial board endorses (candidate last)" <br/> <em>grand rapids press</em> <br/> editorial <br/> january 11, 2008 <br/></b> <br/>"many issues will confront the nation in the next four years, from the ongoing threat of terrorism to the need to find a sensible immigration policy. for michigan, however, one challenge dominates: the economy. we stand at a critical moment, bearing on our backs a worst-in-the-nation unemployment rate, staring at an uncertain future. </p><p>"among (PARTY NAME)s on the ballot in tuesday's presidential primary, two candidates would offer solid leadership, arizona sen. (candidate full) and former massachusetts gov. (candidate full). however, when it comes to michigan's challenges and needs, the passion and knowledge of mr. (candidate last) tip the scales in his favor. during a visit with press editors this week, mr. (candidate last) vowed, 'i will not sleep until michigan is strong and active and vibrant again.' because of that focus, (candidate full) has our vote in the (PARTY NAME) presidential primary." </p><p>... </p><p>"mr. (candidate last) first came to the national stage as the turnaround man for the scandal-plagued 2002 winter olympics in utah. his deft handling of the bribery mess and deficit is a case study in successful management. he served as governor of massachusetts for one term, ending in 2006. there, he worked with the legislature to enact a law that required every citizen of the state to have health insurance, and provided state aid for those who couldn't afford it. as president, he said he would push states to enact their own health care solutions. he would aggressively pursue alternative energy and energy efficiency. he supports merit pay for teachers and more educational choices for parents and children, ideas that deserve furtherance in washington. the next president will need to transcend the stunting polarities that bedevil washington. as the (PARTY NAME) leader of a (PARTY NAME) state, mr. (candidate last) had to reach across partisan boundaries. mr. (candidate last)'s father, george (candidate last), served as governor of michigan in the 1960s, a tie that strengthens his understanding of michigan. he knows that this state's job losses and struggle to find a new economic footing are the 'canary in the mine,' as he rightly put it, for the nation as a whole." </p><p>... </p><p>"but on the issue that matters most to michigan, mr. (candidate last)'s message resonates. in grand rapids this week, he said, 'michigan's one-state recession will come to an end if i'm president.' that's a bold promise. michigan voters should increase his chance to make it reality." </p><p><em>to read the full endorsement, please see:</em> <a href="http://www.mlive.com/elections/michigan/index.ssf/2008/01/press_editorial_board_endorses.html">http://www.mlive.com/</a> </p><p><br/> <b> <u> <em>oakland press</em> endorses governor (candidate last):</u> </b> </p><p><b>"'favorite son' (candidate last) is best gop choice in primary" <br/> <em>oakland press</em> <br/> editorial <br/> january 11, 2008</b> </p><p>"michigan's presidential primary election tuesday certainly has stirred enough controversy nationwide with both political parties. </p><p>"and despite possible sanctions from both national (PARTY NAME) and (PARTY NAME) organizations, it offers michigan residents a chance to send a message and make a statement. </p><p>"particularly on the gop ticket, where all national presidential candidates will be listed. </p><p>"we urge (PARTY NAME) party faithfuls to stand up and vote for (candidate full). although technically not a home state 'favorite son,' his ties to michigan are strong." </p><p>... </p><p>"meanwhile, (candidate full) certainly has the credentials to run the country. he is a former massachusetts governor who turned that state's economy around and proved to be a more than able leader. </p><p>"his ties to michigan and oakland county are obvious." </p><p>... </p><p>"(candidate last) is the first candidate for president with michigan ties since the late gerald ford. </p><p>"if elected, he would be the country's only michigan-born president. </p><p>"his interest in michigan has been strong, probably stronger than any other gop candidate." </p><p>... </p><p>"looking at the obvious, (candidate last) entered the 2008 race with impressive backing in michigan, and his ties to the state are undeniable. he has firsthand knowledge of the auto industry and its importance to michigan. </p><p>"equally critical, (candidate last) knows how to get a state out of debt and, being from michigan, he certainly has an empathy for the state that the other candidates, both gop and (PARTY NAME), don't have. </p><p>"with michigan's horrible economy and other problems, we need as much clout in washington as possible and (candidate last) promises to give us that." </p><p>... </p><p>"but there's no doubt whom state (PARTY NAME)s should vote for - (candidate full)." </p><p><em>to read the full endorsement, please see</em>: <a href="http://www.theoaklandpress.com/stories/011108/opi_20080111161.shtml">http://www.theoaklandpress.com/</a></p></span>
