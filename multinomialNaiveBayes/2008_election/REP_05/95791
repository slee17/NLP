<span class="displaytext"><i>by: governor (candidate full)<br/>national review online<br/>friday, jun 15</i><p>"late last week, two developments involving stem-cell research offered a sharp contrast between the great strengths of american biomedical science and the terrible weakness of washington politics. </p><p>"first, on wednesday, we learned that researchers in massachusetts, building on prior accomplishments by colleagues in japan, had managed to transform regular skin cells into the equivalent of embryonic stem cells in mice. their work points to a way to produce cells with the qualities scientists value about embryonic stem cells, but without the need to create, harm, or destroy human embryos, and therefore without ethical or political controversy. </p><p>"but then, on thursday, the congress passed a bill that would for the first time use taxpayer dollars to encourage the destruction of embryos for research. just as it is becoming increasingly clear that scientific ingenuity could offer a way around the divisive controversies of the stem-cell debate, congressional (PARTY NAME) are working to stoke those very controversies." </p><p>... </p><p>"when i was governor of massachusetts, my state wrestled with the stem-cell debate and i confronted many of the same issues now being debated in washington. i carefully listened to all sides, and came to reject the idea that the exploration of stem cells had to come into conflict with america's commitment to the dignity of human life." </p><p>... </p><p>"in the end, i became persuaded that the stem-cell debate was grounded in a false premise, and that the way through it was around it: by the use of scientific techniques that could produce the equivalent of embryonic stem cells but without cloning, creating, harming, or destroying developing human lives." </p><p>... </p><p>"support for ethical biomedical research should be part of our collective identity as a noble society. instead of turning the quest for cures into a partisan battle, congress should embrace the exciting emerging lines of research that could meet the goals of all sides in the stem-cell debate. ... but the house (PARTY NAME) leadership, choosing politics over the prospect of consensus on science, appears to be unwilling even to allow a vote on that hopeful legislation. </p><p>"it is time to move beyond typical washington politics, and offer support for stem-cell research techniques that bring science and ethics together to promote life, protect life, and save lives." <a class="more" href="http://article.nationalreview.com/print/?q=zmy2otuxmtgyzmm0zdkwmgrmmzhkyjaxzmmyowzlm2u" target="_blank">view entire article</a></p></span>
