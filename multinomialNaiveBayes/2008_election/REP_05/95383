(candidate full), a successful ceo and the target of (candidate last)'s populist broadlines." </p><p>... </p><p>"for (PARTY NAME)s, it's time to be realistic. </p><p>"and the reality is that the next president could be handed a congress controlled by (PARTY NAME), as george w. bush was in 2006. that demands a leader with experience in working with the opposition party." </p><p>... </p><p>"in addition to a pragmatism toward the opposition, another practical concern for (PARTY NAME)s is electability. to win the white house, (PARTY NAME)s need a nominee who can be competitive in states drifting (PARTY NAME) – ohio or colorado, among others. </p><p>"(candidate last) can. on policy matters, the great differences are between the two parties – not, frankly, the serious contenders in either field. </p><p>"it is for that reason that purists should recognize that the crucial test is which of these candidates can win in november. in all respects, (candidate last) looks, sounds and acts presidential, projecting competence and the intelligence to deal comfortably with policy nuance and complexity. in a perilous world, whether the peril is terrorism, global competition or a tanking economy, (candidate full) is the (PARTY NAME) who inspires confidence in his ability to lead. </p><p>"'i will not need briefings on how the economy works; i know how it works,' (candidate last) said last week in florida.

(candidate last) backed a bold state plan to cover the uninsured that required every massachusetts citizen to have health insurance but provided aid for those who couldn't afford it. his business school case-method approach to health care – let states experiment; see who comes up with the best ideas – is the most likely to yield ingenious and flexible solutions to an increasingly worrisome national issue." </p><p>... </p><p>"with the economy gaining on the war in iraq as the leading worry for americans, however, mr.
