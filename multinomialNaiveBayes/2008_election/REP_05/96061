<span class="displaytext"><b>for immediate release</b> <br/> <b>contact:</b> kevin madden (857) 288 - 6390 <p><b> <u>governor (candidate last)'s call to restore the american people's power to participate fully in their elections: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>governor (candidate full) is calling for the repeal of (candidate last)-feingold.</b> governor (candidate last) believes that (candidate last)-feingold restricts our first amendment rights and is bad public policy. he believes we should enact reforms that promote transparency and disclosure, preserve grassroots activism and protect the ability to criticize or endorse current officeholders and candidates. </p><p><b>- governor (candidate last) will fight to restore the free speech rights of the american people.</b> political speech is at the heart of the first amendment. the american people must be allowed to advocate for their candidates and their positions without burdensome limitations. for example, (candidate last)-feingold prohibits some nonprofits from broadcasting messages that mention the name of a federal candidate within 30 days of a primary or in the months leading up to the general election. this free speech blackout period – also called the "electioneering communications ban" – is at odds with a free and open issues debate and should be repealed. </p><p><b>- governor (candidate last) believes grassroots organizations and activism should be encouraged, not restricted.</b> grassroots activities are protected by the first amendment and play a crucial role in elections. rather than encourage debate on issues of public importance, (candidate last)-feingold has silenced some of these groups, empowered special interest groups, and protected incumbents in federal office. (candidate last)-feingold also has opened the door to additional regulation of grassroots organizations, which is exactly the wrong direction. </p><p><b>- governor (candidate last) believes that there must be more transparency and disclosure in campaign finance.</b> (candidate last)-feingold has not accomplished its stated goals of reducing the role of money or special interests in politics. instead, it has driven money into secret corners and given more power to hidden special interests. governor (candidate last) believes we must have more transparency and disclosure in the process, rather than more restrictions and censorship of political speech. </p><p><b> <u>the american people have the right to engage in the (PARTY NAME) process without burdensome and technical federal limitations:</u> </b> </p><p><b>americans must be able to safely exercise first amendment rights without a team of lawyers.</b> in 2004, the group wisconsin right to life wanted to run grassroots radio and television ads urging people in wisconsin to contact their senators (which the ads mentioned by name) and ask them to oppose the ongoing filibusters of president bush's judicial nominees. a provision in (candidate last)-feingold, however, was used to argue that the ads were illegal. a lower court has ruled that the provision is unconstitutional when applied to such grassroots activities and the case is now under review by the u.s. supreme court in the cases of fec v. wisconsin right to life and (candidate last) v. wisconsin right to life. lawsuits simply should not be required for citizens to advocate a particular political position and participate in the (PARTY NAME) process. </p><p><b> <u>governor (candidate last) believes we should enact campaign finance reforms that are guided by three core principles: <br/></u> </b> <br/> <b>- promoting transparency and disclosure; <br/> - protecting the first amendment and the ability to criticize or endorse current officeholders and candidates; <br/> - preserving grassroots activism.</b> </p><p></p></span>
