<span class="displaytext"><b>for immediate release <br/> contact:</b> kevin madden (857) 288-6400 <p><b>boston, ma</b> â€“ governor (candidate full), in direct consideration of the proposed increase in troop deployments in iraq, issued the following statement today putting an emphasis on the need for clear and measurable strategic objectives. </p><p>"i agree with the president: our strategy in iraq must change. our military mission, for the first time, must include securing the civilian population from violence and terror. it is impossible to defeat the insurgency without first providing security for the iraqi people. civilian security is the precondition for any political and economic reconstruction. </p><p>"in consultation with generals, military experts and troops who have served on the ground in iraq, i believe securing iraqi civilians requires additional troops. i support adding five brigades in baghdad and two regiments in al-anbar province. success will require rapid deployment. </p><p>"this effort should be combined with clear objectives and milestones for u.s. and iraqi leaders. </p><p>"the road ahead will be difficult but success is still possible in iraq. i believe it is in america's national security interest to achieve it."</p></span>
