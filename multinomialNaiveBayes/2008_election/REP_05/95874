<span class="displaytext"><b><u>governor (candidate last)'s five step plan of action to prevent a nuclear iran:</u> </b> <p>" <b>first</b>, we must continue tighten economic sanctions. our model should be at least as severe to the sanctions imposed on apartheid south africa. we should demand no less from the international community today ... </p><p>"we must also be imaginative in the way we pressure iran economically - an issue i have been looking into. in my meetings this week in israel, i have become aware of the potential of u.s. pension funds to further isolate the iranian economy. we should explore a selective disinvestment policy. after a series of briefings here, i have contacted the treasurer of my own state of massachusetts and governors of other states to begin this process by meeting today with senior israeli leaders in boston. </p><p>" <b>second</b>, we must impose diplomatic isolation of iran's government. ahmadinejad should not be provided the trappings, respect, and recognition of a responsible head of state as he travels. in fact, when former iranian president khatami traveled to boston last year to lecture at harvard university, i denied him state police security for his visit. the real question is: why was he invited in the first place? ahmadinejad is even more strident than khatami. he should neither be invited to foreign capitals nor feted by foreign leaders. this would have important symbolic significance, not just to ahmadinejad, but to the people of iran. </p><p>"diplomatic isolation should also include an indictment of ahmadinejad for incitement to genocide under the genocide convention. the united states should lead this effort. </p><p>"the full title of the genocide convention is the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide. remember that word: prevention. </p><p>"article iii of that treaty establishes that 'public incitement to commit genocide' is a punishable crime. every signatory to this treaty, including the u.s. and most european countries, shares an obligation to enforce it. so do human rights groups that care about international humanitarian law. </p><p>"nobel prize winner elie wiesel, and human rights advocate and former canadian justice minister irwin cotler have spoken out on this issue. </p><p>"in addition, former u.s. ambassador john bolton has been a forceful advocate for this effort, and is joined by alan dershowitz. if these two can agree, they must be on to something. </p><p>" <b>third</b>, arab states must join this effort to prevent a nuclear iran. these states can do much more than wring their hands and urge america to act. they should support iraq's nascent government, they can help america focus on iran by quickly turning down the temperature of the arab-israeli conflict - stopping the financial and weapons flows to hamas and hizbullah ... thawing relations with israel ... and telling the palestinians they must drop terrorism and recognize israel's right to exist. </p><p>" <b>fourth</b>, we must make it clear that while nuclearization may be a source of pride, it can also be a source of peril. the military option remains on the table. and further, nuclear material that falls into the hands of terrorists would surely provoke a devastating response from the civilized world. </p><p>" <b>fifth</b>, our strategy should be integrated into a broader approach to the broader muslim world. i agree with our friend, former prime minister aznar of spain, that a central purpose of nato should be to defeat radical islam. i believe this has two critical dimensions. the first is an unquestionably capable military. this will mean a greater investment by the united states as well as other nations. the second is a global partnership which includes nato and other allies. its mission would be to support progressive muslim communities and leaders in every nation where radical islam is battling modernity and moderation. this partnership for prosperity should help provide the tools and funding necessary for moderates to win the debate in their own societies. they need secular public schools, micro credit and banking, the rule of law, adequate healthcare, human rights, and competitive economic policies. in the final analysis, only muslims will be able to permanently defeat radical islam. and we can help." </p><p><u> <b>other key excerpts of governor (candidate last)'s remarks as prepared for delivery:</b> </u> </p><p>"and on iraq, i would just like to make another point. some congressional leaders in the united states today are arguing that the president is not authorized to allow our forces to pursue iranian elements inside iraq - which are attacking our own troops. that would be folly."</p></span>
