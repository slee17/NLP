<span class="displaytext"><b>boston, ma –</b> yesterday, governor (candidate full) delivered his "faith in america" address at the george bush presidential library. today, the newspapers and columnists are reflecting upon governor (candidate last)'s words. please find below some key columns: <p><b> <u>kathleen parker: "one nation under mitt" (<em>townhall</em>, 12/7/07):</u> </b> </p><p><b> <em>"he held up a mirror and, for the first time in a long while, americans did not have to avert their gaze. they could see themselves reflected and be both proud and humbled by their country's unique beauty."</em> </b> </p><p>"voters may not know any more about mormonism than they did before (candidate full)'s faith speech on thursday, but they surely know more about what it means to be an american. </p><p>"(candidate last)'s much-anticipated address from the george h.w. bush library at texas a&amp;m reminded americans of some fundamental truths that often get lost in the guerrilla warfare of presidential politics." </p><p>... </p><p>"if kennedy's speech was an important landmark in american political history, (candidate last)'s was surpassing. with heartfelt humility and poetic eloquence, he tracked the nation's struggle with and for freedom. </p><p>"he held up a mirror and, for the first time in a long while, americans did not have to avert their gaze. they could see themselves reflected and be both proud and humbled by their country's unique beauty. </p><p>"that may be the most valuable result of (candidate last)'s speech. he raised the bar by focusing on broad principles of religious freedom, rather than on the small details of doctrinal differences. in the process, he elevated everyone – even those not-so-deserving." </p><p><em>to read the full

</p><p>"if (candidate full) wins the (PARTY NAME) nomination, it will be due in large measure to his splendid and moving defense of his faith and beliefs delivered today at the george bush presidential library." </p><p>... </p><p>"this was a tour de force, and it was delivered before perhaps the largest audience (candidate last) will have for any speech before the january caucuses and primaries. it will be the subject of editorials and columns in coming weeks. and it is hard to see how (candidate last) does not benefit hugely from what was a quintessentially 'american' address." </p><p>... </p><p>"the issues of religious tolerance, what it means to be a christian in politics, and of secularism versus traditionalism are all now out on the table, and will likely be the social-moral issues on which the race turns between now and january. </p><p>"to this writer, (candidate last) is on unassailable grounds. nor is he hurt by the fact that his wife and five children testify eloquently that he is a man of principles who lives by them." </p><p><em>to read the full op-ed, please</em> <a

rhetoric of the presidential campaign so far. </p><p>"he satisfied his first goal – arguing that his mormon faith shouldn't disqualify him – and he did so while affirming his personal loyalty and

refused to bend. 'that i will not do,' he declared.

(candidate last) contrasted the american genius for accommodating religion in public life with europe's history – state religion, followed by sterile secularism – and the islamic world, where a totalist creed often persecutes dissenters. only in america, he argued, are faith and reason held to be compatible within their respective spheres, thus keeping religion vibrant and relevant to (PARTY NAME) life. and this, he contended, is possible because in america, we honor god while respecting religious difference. </p><p>"the message was clear: religious faith and religious tolerance define america's pluralist democracy and make it great. to dishonor that is to be less of a patriot." </p><p><em>to read the full editorial, please</em> <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/editorials/stories/dn-(candidate last)_07edi.art.state.edition1.3789078.html"> <em>click here</em> </a> <em>.</em> </p><p><b> <u>michael gerson: "answering critics – and kennedy" (<em>the washington post</em>, 12/7/07):</u> </b> </p><p><b> <em>"kennedy's speech remains a landmark of american rhetoric. <br/> but (candidate last)'s deserves to be read beside it."</em> </b> </p><p>"before his remarks, (candidate last) tipped his hat to kennedy's houston address as 'the definitive speech.' but (candidate last), speaking at the george h.w. bush presidential library at texas a&amp;m university, declared his independence from the kennedy model. kennedy's speech began by playing down 'religious issues' as a distraction from the 'real issues' of 'war and hunger and ignorance and despair.'
