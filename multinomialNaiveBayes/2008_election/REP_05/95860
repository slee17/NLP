<span class="displaytext"><b>by governor (candidate full) <br/> <em>the wall street journal</em> <br/> september 20, 2007</b> <p>"some of the details have changed, but at the heart of sen. (candidate full)'s new health-care proposal are the same flaws that sunk her first version. they flow from her distrust of markets, from her distaste for profit-motivated private enterprise, and from her consequent faith that washington knows best." </p><p>... </p><p>"as governor of massachusetts, i led the fight for reforms that used free markets and innovation, rather than big-government control, to lower health-care costs and cover the uninsured. i recently proposed a federalist reform plan that will use these principles to improve america's health-care system. </p><p>"sen. (candidate last) has a very different view about the changes we need to make. her plan has several weaknesses and should be distinguished from the reforms i led in massachusetts and the reform plan i have proposed. so let's take a closer look at what her new proposal would really do: </p><p>"raise taxes. the new plan is slated to cost $110 billion a year. and to pay for the new entitlement – a tax hike. that in turn will slow down the economy and make the cost of her system grow even higher. by contrast, both the reforms i led in massachusetts and the federalist reform plan i recently proposed do not raise taxes or increase spending." </p><p>... </p><p>"expand government insurance. people who don't obtain insurance through their employer are invited to buy a government-run, medicare-like plan or enroll in the federal employees health benefits program (fehbp). and so, more americans will end up in government-run insurance. it's the gentle slope to a single payer, socialized medicine model. my plan in massachusetts instead allowed the uninsured to choose a private insurance product from one of the many private insurance companies. </p><p>"impose a national model on everyone. sen. (candidate last) fundamentally distrusts state governments. but the states are closer to the people, and more responsive to them. they are also the laboratories of democracy – the best ideas can come from 50 states each doing their best work. the senator's plan is a one-size-fits-all approach. it ignores significant differences between people and the needs of the 50 different states. federalism is the right approach. the national reforms i have proposed give states financial flexibility to craft their own program to cover the uninsured, a program tailored to the specific needs of their citizens. </p><p>"significantly increase the role of the federal government at the expense of free markets. for example, sen. (candidate last) proposes the creation of an entirely new government-run medicare-like program for the uninsured. inevitably, lobbyists will go to town adding coverage mandates, setting rates and re-shaping plans to fit the wants of their clients. the better path is the market path. let the multitude of private companies compete for the consumer's dollar – the quality and the cost will be much better than what government could ever cobble together. </p><p>"leave the mandate problem unsolved. before you can impose a mandate on employers or individuals to purchase insurance, you need to reform state health insurance markets. otherwise, policies can be so beefed-up with state mandated coverage and regulation that they are simply unaffordable. then a mandate is unfair. </p><p>"moreover, her employer mandate doesn't solve the problem of the uninsured – that's why i vetoed a similar measure when i was governor of massachusetts. i chose an individual mandate only after we had done our best to reform state insurance regulations – lowering premiums by as much as 50%. </p><p>"let's be clear here: my plan in massachusetts worked very differently than sen. (candidate last)'s plan would." </p><p>... </p><p>"i like the plan i put forward in massachusetts. but even so, i wouldn't do what sen. (candidate last) does – impose my way on every other state. other states may borrow from what we did. some will surely improve on it. but let's keep faith in federalism, in private markets and in individual responsibility."... </p><p><em>to read governor (candidate last)'s full op-ed, please see:</em> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/sb119025374664933444.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/sb119025374664933444.html</a></p></span>
