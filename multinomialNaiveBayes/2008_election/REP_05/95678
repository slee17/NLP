<span class="displaytext"><b>for immediate release <br/> contact:</b> kevin madden (857) 288-6390 <p><b>boston, ma â€“</b> today, governor (candidate full) issued the following statement on the current environmental debate: </p><p>"governor mark sanford is right. unfortunately, some in the (PARTY NAME) party are embracing the radical environmental ideas of the liberal left. as governor, i found that thoughtful environmentalism need not be anti-growth and anti-jobs. but kyoto-style sweeping mandates, imposed unilaterally in the united states, would kill jobs, depress growth and shift manufacturing to the dirtiest developing nations. </p><p>"(PARTY NAME)s should never abandon pro-growth conservative principles in an effort to embrace the ideas of al gore. instead of sweeping mandates, we must use america's power of innovation to develop alternative sources of energy and new technologies that use energy more efficiently."</p></span>
