<span class="displaytext"><b>for immediate release <br/> contact:</b> kevin madden (857) 288-6390 <p><b>boston, ma –</b> governor (candidate full) issued the following statement today regarding sunday's scheduled "elections" in cuba: </p><p>"i strongly condemn the castro regime's latest mockery of freedom – evident in the local 'elections' set to take place in cuba this sunday. rather than accept the cuban people's right to free and fair elections, the castro regime instead offers sham elections where only one party – the communist party – gets to field candidates. </p><p>"change is desperately needed in cuba, not a succession of power. sunday's elections should serve as yet another sobering reminder to the world about the gross violations of freedom and human rights that have been taking place in cuba for far too long. that raul castro would submit the cuban people to this farcical and degrading process underscores his determination to preserve a failed regime. it also serves as a reminder of why it is necessary that we not weaken our policy on cuba until the castro regime is dismantled, all political prisoners are freed and a transition to free and fair elections takes place."</p></span>
