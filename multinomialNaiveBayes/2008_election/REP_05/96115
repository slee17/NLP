when we have more local control of our schools.</b> while there is a proper role for the federal government to play in education, it is not in telling parents, teachers, kids and local authorities what to teach or how to run their schools. </p></blockquote> <p><b> <u>governor (candidate last)'s conservative strategy to raise the bar in education:</u> </b> </p><p><b>governor (candidate last) will promote school choice.</b> he believes that when parents and kids are free to choose their school, everyone benefits. that's because competition and choice in educational opportunities – whether

educational expenses of parents who home school their kids. </p></blockquote> <p><b>governor (candidate last) will improve upon and enhance no child left behind (nclb).</b> he believes that no child left behind has played an important role in stressing the role of accountability and high standards in improving our schools. governor (candidate last) will improve nclb by giving states that meet or exceed testing requirements additional flexibility in measuring student performance. he will also improve the law by focusing more attention on individual student progress, rather than the overall progress of schools. </p><p><b>governor (candidate last) will honor teaching as the profession it truly is.</b> he believes that good teachers should be rewarded for their hard work and dedication to the important cause of educating our children. he will support performance-based pay and other initiatives that encourage our best teachers to teach in our highest-need schools. </p><p><b>governor
