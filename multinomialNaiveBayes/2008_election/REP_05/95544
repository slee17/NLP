<span class="displaytext">[<i>key excerpts (as prepared for delivery)</i>:] <p><b>governor (candidate last):</b> <em>"i believe we must do as john f. kennedy did in the 1960s and ronald reagan did in the 1980s: we must cut income tax rates for all americans. this approach is fair, simple and extends the pro-growth benefits of tax rate cuts to all americans. and by increasing incentives, a marginal rate cut will energize our economy and grow and create jobs."</em> (governor (candidate full), remarks at the club for growth, palm beach, fl, 3/29/07) </p><p><b>governor (candidate last):</b> <em>"it's absolutely critical that we make the bush tax cuts permanent. in the process of making the bush tax cuts permanent, let's also drive a stake through the heart of the death tax and truly kill it once and for all."</em> (governor (candidate full), remarks at the club for growth, palm beach, fl, 3/29/07) </p><p><b>governor (candidate last):</b> <em>"liberals urged me to raise taxes, but i knew that the solution to a budget deficit is not to find ways to raise more revenue; it is to cut spending. so i eliminated and combined duplicative and wasteful agencies and programs. that laid the groundwork for what followed: four years of balanced budgets. one commentator said that i didn't just go after the sacred cows, i went after the whole herd. and when i left office, massachusetts had 600 fewer state workers than when i took office."</em> (governor (candidate full), remarks at the club for growth, palm beach, fl, 3/29/07) </p><p><b> <u>maintaining economic growth by lowering taxes:</u> </b> </p><p><b>governor (candidate last) proposes lowering tax rates for all americans.</b> we should strive to keep marginal tax rates on america's families and businesses no higher than those imposed by our major global competitors. we should end tax penalties against saving and investment, and promote fairness and simplicity by ending special interest loopholes and lowering tax rates for all americans. </p><p><b>governor (candidate last) has a record of fighting for lower taxes.</b> as governor of massachusetts, he turned a $250 million retroactive capital gains tax increase into a $250 million refund, made the investment tax credit permanent, passed sales tax holidays, gave property tax breaks to seniors, and in each of his last three years in office, submitted a budget that cut the income tax. </p><p><b> <u>spending:</u> </b> </p><p><b>governor (candidate last) believes washington's focus should be on cutting spending.</b> washington has been on an explosive spending binge. governor (candidate last) has proposed three initiatives to cut spending: vetoing appropriations bills that exceed spending targets;
