'if they could, i would have turned all the people over. it would have helped me. i would have had a smaller population. i would have had fewer problems,' the (PARTY NAME) presidential candidate told the examiner in an interview. 'but the practical reality was, they were going to make an infinitesimal, statistically insignificant contribution to the problem. i was stuck with it. and no matter what their promises, they weren't going to do anything about it.'"

'if you're not hurting anybody in my city, i don't care.'</u> but (candidate last)'s 'i don't care' attitude toward illegals sometimes morphed into unabashed cheerleading, as if he were rolling out the red carpet for them."
