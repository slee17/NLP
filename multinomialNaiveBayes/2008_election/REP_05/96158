(candidate full): "the key to effective homeland security, in my view, is intelligence, finding the attackers before they attack, gathering and analyzing tips, monitoring suspects, wiretapping, surveillance, all of the tools associated with intelligence work. it's aided measurably by the patriot act, perhaps our most effective new tool. it is also dependent on effective delineations of responsibilities between and among federal agencies, across federal and state lines and state and local lines."

(president george w. bush, statement by the president, 8/5/07) </p><p><b>the white house has called for further modernization of fisa and updates to many fisa provisions.</b> "however, as a result of revolutions in telecommunications technology since fisa was passed, fisa now often requires the government to get a court order to collect information on terrorists and other foreign intelligence targets located overseas. it makes no sense to require the government to obtain a court order to collect <u>foreign</u> intelligence on <u>foreign</u> targets located in <u>foreign</u> countries. this requirement impairs our intelligence capabilities, and diverts scarce resources that would be better spent safeguarding the civil liberties of americans, not foreigners who wish to do us harm." (the white house, "fact sheet on fisa modernization," 8/3/07) </p><p><b>- the original fisa does not yet have all of the provisions it needs to protect the american people.</b> "the legislation's authors, instead of focusing on just the target of communication, regulated according to its type: radio or wire. as technology advanced from radio to wire, the very foreign communications congress took pains to exclude from fisa's purview were swept into it."
