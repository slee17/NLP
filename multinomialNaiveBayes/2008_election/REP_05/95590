<span class="displaytext"><b>for immediate release <br/> contact:</b> kevin madden (857) 288-6390 <p><b>boston, ma –</b> today, governor (candidate full) issued the following statement regarding last night's (PARTY NAME) presidential debate and the comments by the leading (PARTY NAME) candidates on our children's education: </p><p>"last night's debate was just the latest example of how out of touch the (PARTY NAME) presidential candidates are with the american people. not one candidate was uncomfortable with young children learning about same-sex marriage in the second grade. this is a subject that should be left to parents, not public school teachers. we need to strengthen our families by passing a federal marriage amendment and also insisting on marriage before having children. change in washington requires (PARTY NAME) with the courage to stand-up to their ultra liberal base and do what's right for our children." </p><p><b> <u>background:</u> </b> </p><p><b>at last night's (PARTY NAME) presidential debate, the candidates were asked if they "would be comfortable having" a story about same-sex marriage read to their children in second-grade.</b> necn's allison king: "the issues surrounding gay rights have been hotly debated here in new england. for example, last year some parents of second graders in lexington, massachusetts, were outraged to learn their children's teacher had read a story about same-sex marriage, about a prince who marries another prince. same-sex marriage is legal in massachusetts, but most of you oppose it. would you be comfortable having this story read to your children as part of their school curriculum? i'm going to start with senator (candidate last)."

(candidate last): "- to all of those possibilities because i don't want to impose my view. nobody made me god. i don't get to decide on behalf of my family or my children, as my wife, elizabeth, who's spoken her own mind on this issue. i don't get to impose on them what it is that i believe is right..."
