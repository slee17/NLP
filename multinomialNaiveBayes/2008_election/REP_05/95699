"the answer is not more government, but more innovation. we must harness the power of free market reforms to provide private insurance options to our citizens without a tax increase and without a big government takeover." </p><p>in a joint statement, the coalition chairmen said, "as governor of massachusetts, (candidate full) applied conservative principles to address the health insurance crisis in his state and is widely recognized as a national innovator in this field. as evidenced by the reform plan he presented to the florida medical association last week, governor (candidate last) is the best equipped candidate to reform our health care system while protecting american taxpayers from a one-size-fits-all program that would result in increased spending and greater regulatory burdens." </p><p><b> <u>(candidate last) for president florida health care professionals coalition chairs:</u> </b> </p><p><b>- frank farmer, m.d.</b>, volusia county <br/> <b>- patrick hutton, m.d.</b>, clay county <br/> <b>- carl lentz, m.d.</b>, volusia county </p><p><b> <u>(candidate last) for president florida health care professionals coalition:</u> </b> </p><p><b>- dennis agliano, m.d.</b>, hillsborough county <br/> <b>- john armstrong, m.d.</b>, alachua county <br/> <b>- jack ayala,</b> broward county <br/> <b>- stephen baker, m.d.</b>, miami-dade county <br/> <b>- david becker, m.d.</b>, pinellas county <br/> <b>- ashley booth, m.d.</b>, duval county <br/> <b>- ed caron, d.c.</b>, orange county <br/> <b>- akshay desai, m.d.</b>, hillsborough county <br/> <b>- neal dunn, m.d.</b>, bay county <br/> <b>- mutaz habal, m.d.</b>, hillsborough county <br/> <b>- w. alan</b> <b>harmmon, m.d.</b>, duval county <br/> <b>- david henderson</b>, volusia county <br/> <b>- humberto j. hernandez, m.d.</b>, miami-dade county <br/> <b>- james howell, m.d.</b>, palm beach county <br/> <b>- e. coy irvin, m.d.</b>, santa rosa county <br/> <b>- barbara jaehne, au.d.</b>, sarasota county <br/> <b>- judi katz</b>, collier county <br/> <b>- sue kennedy, r.n.</b>, pinellas county <br/> <b>- robert lastomirsky, m.d.</b>, sarasota county <br/> <b>- gregory lignelli, m.d.</b>, lee county <br/> <b>- miguel machado, m.d.</b>, st. johns county <br/>- <b>dr. luis martinez, d.m.d, p.a</b>, pinellas county , <br/> <b>- john montgomery, m.d., m.p.h., f.a.a.f.p., c.p.e., c.h.i.e.</b>, duval county <br/> <b>- ryan o'reilly, e.m.t.</b>, pasco county <br/> <b>- jeff parks, m.d.</b>, volusia , county <br/> <b>- david paulus, m.d.</b>, alachua county <br/> <b>- thomas peters, m.d.</b>, duval county <br/> <b>- linda pilkington, r.n.</b>, polk county <br/> <b>- alan pillersdorf, m.d</b>., palm beach county <br/> <b>- craig rappel</b>, indian river county <br/> <b>- manny rose, m.d</b>., pinellas county <br/> <b>- thomas g. salmon, jr., d.d.s, m.s.</b>, okaloosa county <br/> <b>- audrey seay</b>, charlotte county <br/> <b>- joe sharpe</b>, wakulla county <br/> <b>- jack spring, jr.</b>, collier county <br/> <b>- gary winchester, m.d</b>., leon county <br/> <b>- jerry woelfel</b>, sarasota county</p></span>
