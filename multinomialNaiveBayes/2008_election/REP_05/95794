<span class="displaytext"><b>"a stronger america needs stronger families" <br/> by ann (candidate last) <br/> fosters daily (PARTY NAME) <br/> november 30, 2007</b> <p>... </p><p>"mitt always says the most important work for the future of our country is the work that goes on within the four walls of the american home. i can tell you firsthand this is not just campaign rhetoric. mitt's motivation is no different than any other mother and father in america. it's to have our children and grandchildren grow up in an america that is stronger, safer and more prosperous. this core belief has guided mitt as he became a father and now a grandfather." </p><p>... </p><p>"today, parents need to pay closer attention to what their kids are doing – what they are looking at on the internet, who they are talking to on-line, and who are influencing them outside the home. </p><p>"mitt sometimes paraphrases peggy noonan when she says that the world is an ocean where our children swim. she called it a cesspool of violence, sex, drugs and general apathy. if mitt is our next president, he will make it a passionate priority to clean up the water in which our kids are swimming." </p><p>... </p><p>"when i am on the campaign trail, i am often asked where i would focus my attention as first lady. i would not only help raise awareness for diseases like multiple sclerosis, but i would also continue my work with young people. i will focus on helping at-risk youth make the right choices — for example, staying in school, being drug free, promoting abstinence education and promoting marriage before having children. </p><p>"mitt's campaign is about strengthening america – and that starts with strengthening the american family. building a stronger america starts within the four walls of the american home. his priority is to bring conservative family values to washington. with these values, we can leave a better america for future generations." </p><p><em>to read the full op-ed, please</em> <a href="http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20071130/gjopinion_01/711300007/-1/fosopinion"> <em>click here</em> </a> <em>.</em></p></span>
