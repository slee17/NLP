<span class="displaytext"><b>"america's president deserves thanks and respect" <br/> townhall <br/> by governor (candidate full) <br/> december 19, 2007</b> <p>"as americans prepare for the holidays with their families and loved ones, we have many challenges to face but also many reasons to be thankful. we are thankful we live in a nation that is still a land of freedom, hope and opportunity. and we can be thankful that president bush has kept us safe. too often our politicians in washington and on the campaign trail seem to have forgotten this simple fact. </p><p>"it was disheartening when senator (candidate full) (d-ny) questioned the sworn testimony of general david petraeus, the troop commander of our forces in iraq, when he reported on the success of the surge. a disbelieving senator (candidate last) said reports of progress require 'the willing suspension of disbelief.' we now know beyond any reasonable doubt that senator (candidate last) was wrong and general petraeus was right, and yet to this day she has refused to apologize for her unwarranted attack on the integrity of one of our finest soldiers. even in my own party, governor (candidate full) criticized president bush by accusing him of 'an arrogant bunker mentality' in dealing with other nations around the world. just like (candidate full), (candidate full) has refused to apologize." </p><p>... </p><p>"in the wake of 9/11, the president took unprecedented steps to keep us safe and defend americans at home and abroad. we revamped our homeland security apparatus, passed new laws that allowed us to listen in when al-qaeda was calling, cleared out terrorist training camps in afghanistan and successfully toppled the regime of saddam hussein. </p><p>"far from home, our soldiers, national guard and reserves, have overcome early strategic mistakes to make progress in iraq that is both undeniable and should be welcomed by all. this progress has come as america's heroes and their families have made unequalled sacrifices." </p><p>... </p><p>"a half century ago, our mothers and fathers in the greatest generation came together to defeat fascism and communism, promote freedom and civil rights, and build a strong and prosperous country that is the envy of the world. they showed that there is no threat that a united america cannot defeat. by remembering their example, we can overcome the challenges that confront us." </p><p><em>to read the full op-ed, please see:</em> <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/mitt(candidate last)/2007/12/19/americas_president_deserves_thanks_and_respect">http://www.townhall.com/</a></p></span>
