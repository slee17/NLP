<span class="displaytext"><em><b>"huck's gift-givers ended up in state posts" <br/> <em>politico <br/></em> by kenneth p. vogel <br/> december 14, 2007</b> <p>"(candidate full) accepted more than 90 gifts from 21 arkansans he appointed to state posts during his decade as governor, a politico analysis of state public records found. </p><p>"since setting his sights on the white house, those supporters, their families and their companies have kept on giving. they contributed nearly $161,000 to a pre-presidential campaign account and (candidate last)'s official campaign committee since late last year, according to state and federal campaign finance records." </p><p>... </p><p>"in one year, the value of the gifts given to (candidate last) amounted to more than $112,000 – nearly double his $67,000 state salary. and he wrangled with the state ethics commission over gift rules, with the commission twice finding he'd broken them (one violation was later overturned). </p><p>"(candidate last) twice sued the commission, once seeking a statute of limitations on ethics complaints and in another suit he sought to narrow the scope of prohibited gifts. ironically, he was represented before the ethics commission by crass and one other lawyer who donated their services – as gifts. </p><p>"(candidate last) later named one of the attorneys, tom mars, to head the arkansas state police." </p><p>... </p><p>"(candidate last) is an avid hunter and fisherman, and his appointees to the state's influential game and fish commission provide a window into the layered relationship he had with supporters. at least four (candidate last) appointees to the seven-member commission had given the governor gifts and are now counted among his presidential donors. </p><p>"ronald pierce is one of (candidate last)'s longtime fishing buddies and the owner of a bass boat manufacturer. from 1997 to 2000, pierce loaned (candidate last) a pair of boats that today would retail for about $40,000 each. he also gave (candidate last) and his wife, janet, jackets and rain suits. </p><p>"(candidate last) named one of the loaner boats 'state business' because, he once joshed, according to the arkansas (PARTY NAME)-gazette, it allowed his secretary to tell callers 'he's out on state business' when he was on fishing trips. </p><p>"after (candidate last)'s gifts drew some bad press, (candidate last) became concerned that 'it would kind of look bad' if pierce loaned him a new boat, pierce told politico. so pierce's company pulled its loaners and sold the governor a new boat – albeit at a reduced price usually reserved for professional fishermen whose patronage is good marketing. 'the governor driving your boat on the lake is going to help you,' pierce explained. </p><p>"(candidate last) last year tapped pierce for a seat on the game and fish commission and this year pierce and his wife gave $4,600 to (candidate last)'s presidential campaign." </p><p>... </p><p>"in all, (candidate last) accepted more than $54,000 in clothes for himself and his family during his decade as governor. and the lion's share – $25,000 – came from jennings osborne, a colorful businessman who was by far the most generous gift giver to the (candidate last)s. </p><p>"osborne, whose website describes him as 'little rock's own version of elvis' gave (candidate last), his family and staff more than $60,000 worth of gifts, including $11,000 in flowers, nearly $12,000 worth of pastries and more than $25,000 in clothes. </p><p>"(candidate last) appointed osborne to a seat on the commission that oversees the stadium where the university of arkansas football team plays some home games, and osborne and his wife contributed $4,100 to (candidate last)'s presidential campaign." </p><p>... </p><p>"(candidate last) also gave appointments to givers of less extravagant gifts who have yet to appear in his campaign donation reports. </p><p>"he accepted a barbecue grill from a resort owned by the family of a man he appointed to the state's state parks, recreation and travel commission. </p><p>"he accepted as gifts seemingly common services, including car repairs. he reported receiving free eye care and 'eye wear' from an optometrist and an ophthalmologist – both of whom he tapped for spots on the boards overseeing their respective professions. </p><p>"in 1996, when the governor's mansion was being refurbished, (candidate last) received free 'general contracting and interior design services' from designer georg anderson and furnishings from cotton magnate charles adams. the next year, (candidate last) named anderson, as well as adams' wife, myrna vine adams, to the arkansas governor's mansion commission. </p><p>"when adam's furniture gift, worth more than $70,000, was first revealed, (candidate last) claimed it was his family's to keep. he backed down after a lawsuit was filed over the furniture and his family's use of a $60,000-a-year fund, which the arkansas (PARTY NAME)-gazette reported had been used to pay for pizza, a doghouse, a magazine subscription and pantyhose for janet (candidate last). </p><p>"the suit was settled with the furniture still in the mansion and (candidate last), while admitting no wrongdoing, acknowledging a dispute 'regarding reimbursements.'" </p><p>to read the full article, please see: <a href="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=d9eaadae-3048-5c12-001c5684a3c6a533">http://dyn.politico.com/</a></p></em></span>
