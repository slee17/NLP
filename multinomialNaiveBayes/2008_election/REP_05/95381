(candidate full) voted against the bush tax cuts. he says he would still do it again. as we're talking about an economic stimulus plan right now, i'm talking about lowering taxes, both for businesses as well as for individuals so we can get more money into the economy, boost it. senator (candidate last) finds that to be the wrong course. and, i think he's wrong again. i think, instead, we need to make sure that we have folks that understand how the economy works and how we have to keep it growing." </p><p><em>to watch governor (candidate last), please see:</em> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13xpai_r8cu">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13xpai_r8cu</a> </p><p><b> <u>governor (candidate last) on his economic stimulus plan (cnn's "american morning," 1/21/08):</u> </b> </p><p><b>cnn's john roberts:</b> "the short-term economic stimulus: to you, what is the most important component?" </p><p><b>governor (candidate last):</b> "well, i think the key thing in the short-term economic stimulus is to help people get back to work and make sure we have good jobs. we don't see our unemployment rate going up and up and up and don't kick people out of homes. so, i'd put additional support to the fha so that it can guarantee loans to people, and they're going to be able to stay in their homes instead of having them foreclosed. and number two, we're going to create incentives for businesses to start hiring people. we do that a number of ways. one is by allowing them to expense their capital expenditures right away, so they buy more products from other businesses, hiring more people. and also, we say for people over 65 years old, neither the business nor the individual should pay any payroll taxes and that encourages people to stay in the workforce. it also encourages businesses to hire people who are 65 and over." </p><p><b>roberts:</b> "some critics have suggested, governor, that this is too oriented toward business. what do you say?" </p><p><b>governor (candidate last):</b> "well, it's oriented toward jobs. i'm not concerned about the owners of businesses. i'm concerned about the jobs that we have in this country. the best way to grow an economy is to have good jobs, and the best way i know how to do that is to encourage businesses to buy products, to grow, and then to hire people. and so in some cases, we're providing checks to individuals, taxpayers, so they can go out and buy more. and the other is to encourage businesses to make their purchases now and grow the economy that way." </p><p><em>to watch governor (candidate last), please see:</em> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbzniydlwtu">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbzniydlwtu</a></p></span>
