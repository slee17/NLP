[w]e'll see how many are accurate, but i think we're going to have to find a way to demand a higher standard. there is no excuse for unethical conduct on the part of people who go to washington to serve this country. one thing i'd like to add, if i'm lucky enough to be president, i will fight for a provision, for a law, which says that if you're convicted of a crime as a government employee or an appointee – you're convicted of a crime that involves violation of the public trust, you've done some kind of abuse of your position – that you get stripped of your pension. a lot of people go [to washington] for pensions. we're going to take away their pensions if they violate our trust."
