(candidate last), 2003: "amnesty has to be an important part."</b> " <u>'amnesty has to be an important part because there are people who have lived in this country for 20, 30 or 40 years, who have raised children here and pay taxes here and are not citizens</u>. that has to be a component of it,' he said. 'how can we have a temporary worker program if we're not allowing people who have been here for 30 years to hold jobs here?'"

(candidate full) and ted kennedy have a bill that, surprise, includes a generous guest worker program that would encourage border jumping. illegals who register would have to pay a fine and taxes, but they would get to stay here and apply for permanent residency. that sure beats waiting at the border and hoping to be let in."
