'as a matter of fact we are relieved. we went into this not because we aspired to the office but simply because we felt that under the circumstances, we would not feel right if we did not offer our service.' </p><p>"in 1969, president nixon invited dad to be secretary of housing and urban development. dad opened the way for manufactured housing, which made homes more affordable for millions of americans. and he fought for integration in housing - not popular with everyone, even within the nixon administration, but it was the right thing to do. </p><p>"last year, a friend gave me one of his old campaign fliers. it said 'george (candidate last) - man of action.' boy, they got that right. from most humble roots, he rose to lead an auto company, a constitutional convention, a state and a federal department. </p><p>"and in each, his will, his integrity and his energy achieved the nearly impossible."</p></span>
