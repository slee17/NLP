"we are fighting each other – but who is fighting for this country?" </p><p>"we need to stop fighting among ourselves – and put the interests of the people above our own. we need to be the united people of the united states. the job of the president is to somehow remind us that we are a great, resilient nation that has to work together to solve all of these problems," he said. </p><p>on topics ranging from education reform to health care and energy and the environment, (candidate last) outlined a results-driven agenda that reflects his optimistic vision for america. </p><p>(candidate last), who served as governor of arkansas for 10 ½ years, said he had "the most experience of anyone on the stage and an impressive record" on education. "we raised standards. we measured and held people accountable for results." </p><p>while the primary responsibility for education is with the states, (candidate last) said the federal government can play a "pivotal role by making sure that the best practices of what is working in the states gets to those states that are struggling. </p><p>"any time you give governors the opportunity to know what works, they'll use it because it creates jobs and economic development," he said. </p><p>(candidate last) also asserted that a primary job of the president, besides being commander-in- chief, is to be "communicator-in-chief." as president, (candidate last) said he would use the bully pulpit to reform education. </p><p>"for a president to say it's none of my business is recklessly irresponsible," he said. </p><p>noting that 6,000 students drop out of school every day and one-third of high school students do not graduate, he said "it is unacceptable that so many kids leave our schools every single day." </p><p>calling himself a passionate advocate of including music and the arts instruction as part of all students' curriculum to increase creativity, he said: "we need to unleash what i call the ‘weapons of mass instruction' </p><p>during the debate, (candidate last) affirmed that america's mounting national debt is indeed a national security issue.
