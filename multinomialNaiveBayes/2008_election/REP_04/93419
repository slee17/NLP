<span class="displaytext">"i am seeking the presidency because i care deeply about important issues facing americaâ€”life, marriage, the fair tax, the second amendment, american border security and sovereignty. i am as committed to those issues as i ever was, and my campaigning around the country has convinced me that the majority of (PARTY NAME)s want me to continue to fight for these and other conservative causes. so i will. <p>i know all about the rumors swirling around. that's why i just went on national news show this afternoon, to knock those rumors down. i am still in this race. as i have said all along, i am in this race until someone gets to 1,191 delegates. that has not happened yet, and so i will keep campaigning for the (PARTY NAME) nomination. period. that's my ironclad commitment to my supporters."</p></span>
