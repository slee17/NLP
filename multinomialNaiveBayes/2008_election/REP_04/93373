<span class="displaytext">berlin , new hampshire -- (PARTY NAME) presidential candidate and former arkansas governor (candidate full) today strongly denounced push polling activities in iowa, new hampshire, and any state in the country. <p>"as i've said before, our campaign has nothing to do with push polling and i wish they would stop. we don't want this kind of campaigning because it violates the spirit of our campaign. i want to become president because i am the best candidate, not because i disabled the other candidates,"said (candidate last). </p><p>national campaign manager chip saltsman agreed: "anyone who has the slightest understanding of the race ahead and the mindset of voters would know this sort of activity is extremely counterproductive. it takes the campaign off message at a time when governor (candidate last) is resonating with voters as never before. it loses votes rather than gains them. it's an underhanded way of doing business that is not welcomed by the campaign and it flies in the face of what governor (candidate last) stands for: integrity and clean politics. on behalf of governor (candidate last) and his campaign, i ask once again that these calls be stopped immediately."</p></span>
