<span class="displaytext">"today is the 35th anniversary of a great american tragedy, the roe vs. wade court decision that has led to the loss of millions of innocent lives. these children were denied the right to life our constitution grants to everyone in america, only because they had yet to emerge from their mother's womb. as president bush noted today, america is better than this. <p>"i support and have always supported passage of a constitutional amendment to protect the right to life. as president, i will fight for passage of this amendment. my convictions regarding the sanctity of life have always been clear and consistent, without equivocation or wavering. i believe that roe v. wade should be over-turned. </p><p>"i applaud those who are marching in washington and elsewhere to call attention yet again to this terrible injustice. i stand with them in calling for the passage of a constitutional amendment to overturn roe v. wade and restore the constitutional rights of the unborn, and i will march with them next year if i am elected president. as president, i pledge that i will continue the fight so that every child can have his or her god-given right to life."</p></span>
