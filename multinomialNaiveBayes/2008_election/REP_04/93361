<span class="displaytext">little rock, ar â€“ former arkansas gov. and presidential candidate (candidate full) has issued the following comment in response to recent gop endorsements: <p>"the rev. pat robertson's endorsement of former mayor (candidate last) proves once again that we are blessed to live in the greatest country in the world. people have the right to support the candidate of their choice, even when that candidate has sharp differences on the most fundamental issue of human life and the sanctity of the unborn. </p><p>"regarding senator brownback's endorsement of senator (candidate last), i respect his decision and believe wholeheartedly that senator (candidate last) is a great patriot and public servant. however, there are key differences between senator (candidate last)'s record and my results-driven record of leadership as a twice-elected (PARTY NAME) governor of the state of arkansas. sen. (candidate last) and i share a positive vision for america's future but there are key differences. i urge senator brownback's supporters to take a close look at my record. i welcome and value their support."</p></span>
