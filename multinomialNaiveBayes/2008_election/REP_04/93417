"i look forward to working with matt in delivering key coalitions to the caucuses on jan. 3 for governor (candidate last)." </p><p>reisetter worked as a college ministry director for seven years at nazareth church in cedar falls and is the part-time associate pastor at first christian church in the same community. most recently, he has been employed by the iowa family policy center, where he will continue in a volunteer leadership role during his time with the (candidate last) campaign. </p><p>"i had a great feeling about governor (candidate last) the very first time i met him way back in 2004. since then, i've been watching him, listening to him, studying him and spending some time with him," reisetter said. "not only do i share his political views, and not only do we share core values that transcend politics, but i fully believe that (candidate full) is the right leader for america at this critical juncture in our nation's history. and he's our best chance to beat (candidate full) in 2008." </p><p>he added, "it is imperative that we elect a man of his caliber. i'm proud to wear myself out to help his campaign succeed. it's an opportunity i just could not pass up. and frankly, i wasn't willing to look in the mirror if, for whatever reason, governor (candidate last) ended up not being our president, wondering, ‘could i have made a difference in the outcome?' and regretting not jumping in with both feet." </p><p>born and raised in cedar falls, he graduated from the university of northern iowa in 1998 with a science degree and is working toward a master's degree in transformational leadership at bethel seminary in st. paul. reisetter also sought election to the iowa house in 2006. </p><p>he and reisetter and his wife, jen, have two children. they reside in cedar falls.</p></span>
