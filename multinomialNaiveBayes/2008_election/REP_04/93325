"if we replace the irs with the fair tax, we lift the burden off of the small- and medium-sized businesses who create most of the jobs. then the only people who we then have to feel sorry for are the legions of washington lobbyists who manipulate the current complicated code for somebody else," (candidate last) said.</p></span>
