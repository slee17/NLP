<span class="displaytext">little rock, ar â€“ former arkansas governor and presidential candidate (candidate full) issued the following statement today: <p>"my presidential campaign has defied the odds, and will continue to do so, as we head into the super tuesday primaries, proving the power of message over money and mechanics. i believe the record will show that mine has been one of the most cost-effective presidential campaigns in recent history -- at a time when the campaign season has been the longest. this affirms what i have always known, that this country is not for sale and the office of president cannot be bought. </p><p>"my campaign filed our year-end 2007 fec report in compliance with federal law -- and all of the details are available online. while my fund-raising has increased significantly, with each quarter outperforming the previous one, a majority of my donors are a part of a grassroots army of concerned citizens from across america -- individuals who may have limited financial means but who care about this country deeply and are giving what they can to support my campaign. </p><p>"at every juncture, i've been amazed at the power of the people, who represent the core strength and values of this country. i am deeply appreciative of their support, which has fueled my candidacy and will continue to power our campaign in the weeks and months ahead."</p></span>
