<span class="displaytext">columbia, scâ€“ former south carolina governor david beasley issued the following statement today on behalf of gov. (candidate full)'s presidential campaign:<p>"i can't fathom the idea of the national right to life organization endorsing anyone in the field besides gov. (candidate full). (candidate full) has worked in the vineyards and trenches on behalf of the pro-life movement. his pro-life record is outstanding and it is more consistent than any other candidate for president. he is also arguably the most electable candidate in the field. </p><p>"if, in fact, they endorse (candidate full) over (candidate full), i'm disappointed because (candidate full) doesn't support a constitutional amendment protecting human life. it just goes to show that, at first blush, even the best of organizations may have yielded to washington politics and made a mistake. in my opinion, this would be one of them.</p><p>"i look forward to (candidate full) receiving the support of the grassroots pro-life movement around the country."</p></span>
