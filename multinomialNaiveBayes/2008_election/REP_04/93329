<span class="displaytext">columbia, sc - today, the following businessmen from arkansas released a statement in support of former arkansas governor, (candidate full): scott t. ford, president and ceo, alltel corporation; warren a. stephens, president and ceo, stephens inc.; madison murphy, former chairman, murphy oil corporation; john tyson, chairman of the board, tyson foods, inc; and french hill, chairman and ceo, delta trust and banking corporation: <p>"we are a traditionally bi-partisan group of executives of several of the largest corporations headquartered in the state of arkansas, each with considerable exposure to the administration of governor (candidate full). of late, governor (candidate last) has attracted what we believe to be unwarranted criticism regarding his business record." </p><p>"our experience with governor (candidate last) indicates that he not only values greatly the freedoms of religion and liberty, but of the free market as well. he is an atypical leader who garnered the respect of not only the professional business community but of the working men and women across our state as well." </p><p>"when he became our governor, he inherited our long sub-standard education system, infrastructure, and regulatory climate. under his leadership, we were able to grow our businesses, increase our employment, reduce our litigation exposure and enjoy, along with all of our fellow arkansans, a healthier economy, improved schools, updated highways, and new healthcare delivery facilities." </p><p>"in our support of governor (candidate last)'s truly conservative, small government business outlook and his pragmatic, yet compassionate style of governing, we invite you to look past the shallow rhetoric of yet another campaign season to see what we have experienced first hand - that with the right political leadership in place, businesses and citizens can jointly prosper and as they do, they contribute so much more to the economic and societal fabric of a community than simply tax revenues."</p></span>
