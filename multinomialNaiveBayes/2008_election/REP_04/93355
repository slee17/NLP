<span class="displaytext">"my candidacy is, and always has been, about convictions – and the issues and core values that are critical to our country's future, such protecting traditional marriage, the sanctity of life, individual empowerment and a revamping of our federal tax code to encourage productivity. it's about lifting americans up, from hope to higher ground, with a positive vision for america's future that is grounded in a belief in our nation's basic goodness, and defined by a ‘can—do' spirit that knows how to gets things done. my goal is to offer (PARTY NAME) voters, a voice and a choice in this election. <p>"the last four out of five u.s. presidents have been governors, and there is a reason for this: the challenges facing our nation require steady, experienced, executive management. as governor of arkansas for 10 ½ years, i delivered on my promises to cut taxes 94 times, reduce welfare by half, reform health care for children and our education system, and transform our transportation infrastructure. my record of results, achieved with a (PARTY NAME) legislature, gives a meaningful viability to my candidacy.</p><p>"there are millions of (PARTY NAME)s from across this country who have yet to be heard from. clearly we were disappointed by the results in wisconsin, but i look forward to campaigning hard in texas and ohio this week – and taking my case before the good people of those states."</p></span>
