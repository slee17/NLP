<span class="displaytext">little rock, ar -- former arkansas governor and presidential candidate (candidate full) has issued the following comment in response to the death of william f. buckley:<p>"janet and i were sad to hear the news of william f. buckley's passing. as one of the founders of the modern conservative movement, william buckley helped turn the intellectual and political tide, shifting america from liberalism to conservatism. our country, and our world, are better for his 82 years on this earth. </p><p>bill buckley was also one of a kindâ€”a scholar, an activist, a wit, a harpsichord player. as a young man, he wrote god and man at yale, an enduring critique of secular liberalism. in 1955, his national review burst into prominence, influencing many millions of young conservatives, including one youngster from a little town in arkansas. to this day, his magazine stands as one of the most important voices of conservative opinion. in addition, he produced a seemingly endless quantity of books, novels, articles, columns, and tv shows. </p><p>so all conservatives owe bill buckley a great debt. today, while our thoughts and prayers are with the buckley family, we conservatives continue to draw inspiration from his life and work. but there is more to be done. it is up to us to carry on, fulfilling his enormous legacy."</p></span>
