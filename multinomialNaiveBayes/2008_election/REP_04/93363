<span class="displaytext">little rock, ar ˆ former arkansas governor and presidential candidate (candidate full) announced the launch of his arkansas gop leadership team today ˆ a group that includes a growing list of current and former federal and state (PARTY NAME) officials from the natural state. <p>"(PARTY NAME)s in arkansas have a long track record of taking on difficult tasks, overcoming tremendous challenges and winning battles that no one thought we could win," (candidate last) said. "despite being in a mostly (PARTY NAME) state, we had great success in cutting taxes, passing pro-life legislation, fighting for the family, improving education and highways and making government more efficient." </p><p>"i have known governor (candidate last) for many years, and at one time, i served as his chief legal counsel," former u.s. attorney bud cummins said. "he is a true leader, who makes firm, informed decisions based on simple standards of right and wrong and what is best for the citizens who elected him. he owns his decisions and doesn't need to take a poll before deciding to do what's right. he has been so successful with his straightforward approach that it makes you wonder why more of these people don't try it." </p><p>"the two main reasons i support gov. (candidate last) for president are the fact that he has always been pro-life ˆ and he has more than 10 years of executive experience," former cong. jay dickey said. "gov. (candidate last) far outdistances himself from the other candidates by his outstanding moral values and conservative convictions." </p><p>"for the past 14 years, i have watched (candidate full) lead our state," former u.s. rep. asa hutchinson said. "he fought the (PARTY NAME) machine in arkansas and brought honor and dignity to our highest office. he has campaigned long and hard for our (PARTY NAME) candidates to help build a better arkansas ." </p><p>"i had the privilege of serving for eight years in the legislature during the (candidate last) administration," sen. shawn womack said. "anyone who saw his leadership during the hurricane katrina relief effort had to be impressed by the way he was able to organize the resources of the state to provide relief and comfort to the tens of thousands of evacuees." </p><p>"my experience with gov. (candidate last) that of a man who was thoughtful and well reasoned in his decisions," former rep. doug matayo said.
