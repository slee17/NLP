<span class="displaytext">chicago, il - senator (candidate last) today released the following statement in response to president bush's veto of stem cell bill <p>"by vetoing funding for stem cell research once again, the president is deferring the hopes of millions of americans who do not have the time to keep waiting for the cure that may save or extend their lives. the promise that stem cells hold does not come from any particular ideology, it is the judgment of science, and we deserve a president who will put that judgment first and make this promise real for the american people."</p></span>
