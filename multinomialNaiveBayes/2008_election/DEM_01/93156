<span class="displaytext">"on this thanksgiving, as we spend time with our family and friends, let's all reflect on what we're thankful for in our own lives. and let's remember those who cannot be with their loved ones because they're serving overseas. but let's also do our part to help those who have no place to go for a meal. amid reports that more and more americans are visiting food pantries at a time when those same pantries are less and less able to help them, i will be volunteering this week at the new horizons food pantry in manchester, new hampshire. and i encourage all americans to do what they can to help those in need -- because the best way to show our gratitude for what we have is by doing our part for those who have less."</span>
