"no more unpredictable deployments. no more extended tours. no more failures to plan, to communicate down the chain of command, or to reset the equipment that we've left in iraq. when we've got service-members who have to find out that their tour has been extended in a phone call home, we're not keeping that trust, and we're not keeping this country safe." </p><p>(candidate last) said that as president, he will require a period of rest and standard of readiness before guard troops can be redeployed. he also said that he will elevate the chief of the national guard to the rank of a four-star general and make him or her a member of the joint chiefs of staff. to ensure that guardsmen and reservists and their families are taken care of back home, (candidate last) said he will improve mental health care, including screening and treatment for ptsd, and will extend the family medical leave act so that spouses have time to care for their families when their wife or husband is called up. finally, (candidate last) said he understands the critical role the guard and reserves play in their states, and will work with governors across the country to ensure they can accomplish their missions back home. </p><p>"i will not be a president who sends our guard off to fight in a misguided war, while telling america's governors to hope that a big snowstorm won't hit next winter, or that a tornado won't come through town. i will not be a president who extends tours for our guard units overseas, while americans are stranded on rooftops right here at home. we need to turn the page," (candidate last) said.</p></span>
