<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- below is a statement from (candidate full) on disturbing reports that 'mentally distressed veterans from iraq and afghanistan are being recruited for government tests on pharmaceutical drugs linked to suicide and other violent side effects.' full story follows. <p>"it is outrageous and unacceptable that our government would irresponsibly endanger veterans who have already sacrificed so much for our country. our veterans - particularly those suffering from mental health injuries - should have the very best health care and support in the world, they should never be needlessly exposed to drugs without proper notification of the dangers involved or effective monitoring of the side effects. i will immediately be asking for a full and thorough investigation of how our government could yet again let down our veterans and their families who have given so much to their country, and who have paid so much for the failures of civilian leadership in washington. it is time to demand accountability and to ensure that this kind of breach of trust never takes place again," said (candidate full).</p></span>
