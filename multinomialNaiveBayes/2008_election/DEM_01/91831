(candidate full) is<br/> the best candidate in a well qualified field of (PARTY NAME) to make those long overdue changes. we<br/> endorse his candidacy enthusiastically. </p><p>in the past few months, iowa city area voters have had multiple opportunities to learn about the<br/> strengths of each of (candidate last)'s (PARTY NAME) rivals: </p><p>* delaware sen. (candidate full) brings an impressive domestic legislative record that is outshone only by<br/> his expertise as a foreign policy adviser. </p><p>* connecticut sen. (candidate full) provides a familial perspective on how the u.s.'s moral authority in<br/> the world has sunk from its highpoint (when (candidate last)'s father was a prosecutor in the nuremberg trials)<br/> to its nadir (when the bush administration refused to abide by the geneva conventions and decided to<br/> house "enemy combatants" in guantanamo bay). </p><p>* new york sen. hillary rodham (candidate last) draws from her experience as a key adviser during her<br/> husband's presidency and her seven years on capitol hill representing the interests of new york's<br/> various population groups. </p><p>* new mexico gov. (candidate full) draws upon experience even wider and deeper than (candidate last)'s and<br/> offers real world examples from the state he has governed since 2003. </p><p>* and former north carolina sen. (candidate full) brings a needed attention to the social, economic and<br/> cultural factors that are widening the divide between the "two americas." </p><p>but the more (candidate last), (candidate last) and (candidate last) draw upon their experience in the internecine personal battles<br/> within washington or between world leaders, the more voters identify them with the broken political<br/> system in which they have gained their experience. and the more (candidate last) and (candidate last) lay claim to<br/> an outsider status, the more they risk having their call for change get lost in their rhetoric --<br/> which is what seems to have happened especially to (candidate last) in this campaign. </p><p>(candidate last) stands tall among this already strong group as both the candidate of hope and the candidate of<br/> change we can believe in. </p><p>u.s. image abroad </p><p>we respect the experience that (candidate last), (candidate last), (candidate last) and (candidate last) bring to the table in terms of<br/> their past meetings with world leaders. but we have to agree with (candidate last) that foreign policy and<br/> diplomacy is more than the personal interactions of a few diplomats and leaders projected across a<br/> geo-political screen. as (candidate last) told the editorial board, "structuring the actual conversation ...<br/> (and) convening the leaders is the easy part." </p><p>the hard part is knowing the people -- whether it's those americans living the relatively average<br/> life that he and his wife lived until just a few years ago, whether it's the people who live in the<br/> south side chicago neighborhoods in which (candidate last) was an organizer, or whether it's the people who<br/> live in the same isolated kenyan village as (candidate last)'s grandmother. </p><p>although (candidate last)'s fellow candidates scoff that living in indonesia for four years as a child doesn't<br/> prepare him for the complexities of foreign affairs, many people throughout the globe will take<br/> comfort knowing that the u.s. president has lived in and knows well the most populous muslim country<br/> in the world. it will help (candidate last) successfully convene a meeting of muslim leaders within his first<br/> year in office. </p><p>of course, winning over the hearts and minds of billions of skeptical muslims will be much easier<br/> after president (candidate last) closes guantanamo bay and begins a phased withdrawal of u.s. troops in iraq. </p><p>u.s. image at home </p><p>(candidate last) is also right that resetting the world's view of the u.s. begins with making our government<br/> more transparent. as a senator, he's worked to visibly link members of congress to their roads to<br/> nowhere and to their iowan rain forests. as president, he will hold large-scale, open discussions on<br/> the issues facing americans in the 21st century: health care, climate change, comprehensive<br/> immigration reform, border security, tax policy, education and economic development. </p><p>unlike the health care overhaul attempted during bill (candidate last)'s administration, for example, (candidate last)<br/> has pledged to hold open meetings and conferences for all the nation to see. bringing together<br/> doctors, nurses, patients and hospital administrators -- as well as representatives of the drug and<br/> insurance companies -- (candidate last) will produce a plan that moves beyond the limits of backroom politics. </p><p>it's true that a single-payer health care system would make the most sense if the u.s. were<br/> establishing a system from scratch. but (candidate last) understands that, given more than half-century history<br/> of employer-provided health care and its supporting industry, the nation can't easily make a<br/> 180-degree turn. nor can citizens wait around for some ideologically pure system to be developed.<br/> because people need help now, (candidate last)'s plan provides the best alternative: establishing a government<br/> system that covers those ineligible for private care and making it effective enough that others<br/> might eventually look to join it. </p><p>he will use the bully pulpit of the presidency to likewise address climate change, education and<br/> economic opportunity. </p><p>politics of hope, unity </p><p>during the recent des moines register debate, (candidate last) joked that he is looking forward to (candidate last)<br/> serving as his presidential adviser. but we hope he is serious about drawing upon the wealth of<br/> experience and talent represented in his presidential rivals. </p><p>indeed, the first test of (candidate last)'s role as a true uniter will be to bring together his party into a<br/> winning coalition in november 2008. in that process, we urge him to infuse his campaign with a<br/> little more of (candidate last)' public focus on poverty -- while avoiding the flights of populist rhetoric<br/> that has made (candidate last)' good analysis sometimes too easy for critics to dismiss. </p><p>(candidate last) has the right vision for a new national politics and a new global reputation. he now needs<br/> voters and supporters who will help him transform that vision into reality. it's a transformation<br/> that should have started three years ago. neither the nation nor the world can wait any longer.</p></span>
