<span class="displaytext">chicago, il-- senator (candidate full) today made the following statement in response to the u.s. supreme court decision regarding abortion. <p>"i strongly disagree with today's supreme court ruling, which dramatically departs from previous precedents safeguarding the health of pregnant women. as justice ginsburg emphasized in her dissenting opinion, this ruling signals an alarming willingness on the part of the conservative majority to disregard its prior rulings respecting a woman's medical concerns and the very personal decisions between a doctor and patient. i am extremely concerned that this ruling will embolden state legislatures to enact further measures to restrict a woman's right to choose, and that the conservative supreme court justices will look for other opportunities to erode roe v. wade, which is established federal law and a matter of equal rights for women."</p></span>
