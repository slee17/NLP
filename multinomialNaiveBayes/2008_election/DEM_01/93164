<span class="displaytext">"what has happened to the jena 6 reminds us that we have not yet reached the ideal of equal justice for all in this country. i am concerned that the sentence in this case appears unusually long and was issued by the same judge whose previous ruling was overturned as clearly erroneous. i hope that the appeals court will consider all relevant factors, including the background of this troubling case, in determining what, if any, punishment is appropriate for this young man. and i once again call on the department of justice to fully investigate this case to see if the civil rights of all these young men have been violated by our criminal justice system."</span>
