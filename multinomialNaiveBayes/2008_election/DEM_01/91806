(candidate last) rooted his agenda in his values and sense of history. his call for this joshua generation to take risks and be courageous in their pursuit of justice was somehow both evocative of jfk and powerfully original."</i> [christopher edley, professor and dean, university of california, berkeley school of law; former special counsel to president (candidate last) and associate director of the white house office of management and budget]</p><p><i>"barack once again proves that he is a candidate who can inspire hope, has the experience necessary to bring people together to tackle some of the most pressing challenges of our time, and can craft solutions that will unify the nation in promoting equal justice and equal opportunity for all. these are the qualities that uniquely define barack as a leader who is well prepared to be our next president."</i> [cassandra butts, senior vice president for domestic policy, center for american progress] </p><p><i>"senator (candidate full) offers a candid and refreshing assessment of our state of civil rights and racial justice in america today. these are difficult questions to address, but senator (candidate last) refuses to allow tough issues to divert him from his mission of restoring america's legacy of fairness and justice. his howard university speech reminds me of president johnson's historic address there in 1965. johnson stepped up to the plate at a difficult time on matters of race in america and senator (candidate last) is stepping up at a time when strong, progressive and new leadership is desperately needed. (candidate full) is good for america."</i> [charles ogletree, jesse climenko professor of law and founding and executive director of the charles hamilton houston institute for race and justice, harvard law school] </p><p><i>"(candidate full) continues to both awe and inspire me. senator (candidate last)'s remarks at howard university put on display the kind of visionary leader that he is - and that the country so desperately needs. the plan he articulated to strengthen our civil rights and criminal justice laws is a clear, thoughtful, and well reasoned approach to addressing some of this country's most pressing issues. senator (candidate last) is deeply committed to ensuring equal justice for all, a core value to our democracy. significantly, "equal justice for all" is not a mere slogan for senator (candidate last) - he provided a roadmap to move the country closer to this ideal."</i> [ronald s. sullivan, jr., harvard law school professor, former director of the public defender service for the district of columbia]</p></span>
