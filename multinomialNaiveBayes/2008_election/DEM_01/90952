<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- senator (candidate last) today released the following statement on equal pay day. <p>"equal pay day is about the fundamental american principle that if you work hard and do a good job, you should be rewarded for your success, regardless of what you look like, where you come from, or what gender you are. and yet, many women today are still earning less than men for the same work â€” making it harder for single mothers to climb out of poverty, and for elderly women to retire with security.</p><p>"this pay gap is an ugly reflection of the discrimination that still exists in the workplace. and as the son of a single mother and the father of two young daughters, i believe we have a responsibility to close it. that's why i've fought to ensure equal pay for equivalent work in illinois and in the u.s. senate, and proposed increasing the equal employment opportunity commission's funding and staffing, and making sure it is led by appointees with a strong commitment to ending discrimination. and that's why tomorrow, i will vote for the ledbetter fair pay act to overturn an unfair supreme court decision and ensure that workers can seek a remedy for any paycheck that reflects pay discrimination, no matter when they received it.</p><p>"in the end, while closing the pay gap is essential, it is not sufficient to make sure that women and girls have an equal shot at the american dream. we need to update the social contract to reflect the realities that working women face each day by providing seven paid sick days each year, helping all fifty states adopt paid leave for their workers, doubling federal funding for quality after-school programs, and encouraging flexible work schedules to help parents balance work and family.</p><p>"on this equal pay day, let's remember that closing the pay gap is about more than just passing a law or implementing a policy. it's about living up to our founding promise of equality for all."</p></span>
