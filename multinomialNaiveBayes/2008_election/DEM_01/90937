<span class="displaytext">chicago, il - senator (candidate last) issued the following statement today in response to reports that 4,000 american servicemen and women have now been killed in iraq since the war began. <p>"it is with great sadness that we have reached another grim milestone in iraq, with at least 4,000 of our finest americans having been killed. each death is a tragedy, and we honor every fallen american and send our thoughts and prayers to their families. it is past time to end this war that should never have been waged by bringing our troops home, and finally pushing iraq's leaders to take responsibility for their future. as we do, we must serve the memory of all who have died as well as they served our country, by providing support for their families, caring for our troops and veterans, and upholding the american values which our fallen heroes exemplified through their service."</p></span>
