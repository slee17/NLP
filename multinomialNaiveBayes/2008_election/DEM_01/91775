<span class="displaytext">springfield, il -- the african american members of the illinois general assembly today unanimously endorsed (candidate full) for president. the african american members of the chicago city council unanimously endorsed (candidate last) this fall. <p>"(candidate full) has spent 20 years delivering change we can believe in to communities across illinois," said senate president emil jones. </p><p>"(candidate full) started his career in public service on the south side of chicago, organizing folks who had little hope to strengthen their families and their communities. in springfield, he fought to outlaw racial profiling, to prevent innocent people from being sent to death row, and to provide health care coverage to an additional 150,000 illinois residents. in washington, he secured increased investments for predominately black institutions to make higher learning more affordable for our children and to protect homeowners from risky loans and foreclosures. every time we needed his help, (candidate full) stood up for us, and we need to stand up for him by voting on february 5th to elect barack our next president." </p><p>"our next president shouldn't be judged by the number of years they have spent in washington, they should be judged by whether or not they have delivered change for our communities," added representative david miller. "we need to elect (candidate full) to take on the great challenges facing our communities - we know from his time in chicago, springfield, and washington that he's able to unite folks from all walks of life to get things done. he stands up to special interests and defends our families no matter what the pundits say. starting today, we've got to educate our friends and neighbors about (candidate full), and then on february 5th we will turn out the vote for barack in force." </p><p>endorsing (candidate full) today are: </p><p>illinois state senate: </p><p>state senate president emil jones<br/> senator jackie collins<br/> senator james f. clayborne jr<br/> senator ricky hendon<br/> senator mattie hunter<br/> senator kimberly lightford<br/> senator james meeks<br/> senator kwame raoul<br/> senator donne trotter </p><p>illinois state representatives: </p><p>rep. annazette collins<br/> rep. marlow colvin<br/> rep. monique davis<br/> rep. william davis<br/> rep. kenneth duncan<br/> rep. mary flowers<br/> rep. lashawn ford<br/> rep. esther golar<br/> rep. deborah graham<br/> rep. constance howard<br/> rep. elga jefferies<br/> rep. charles jefferson<br/> rep. david miller<br/> rep. milton patterson<br/> rep. al riley<br/> rep. arthur turner<br/> rep. eddie washington<br/> rep. karen yarbrough<br/> rep. wyvetter younge</p></span>
