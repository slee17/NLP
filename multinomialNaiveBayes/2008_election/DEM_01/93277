<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- "(candidate full) offered to meet (candidate full) at five joint appearances between now and election day—the three traditional debates plus a joint town hall on the economy in july and an in-depth debate on foreign policy in august. that package of five engagements would have been the most of any presidential campaign in the modern era—offering a broad range of formats—and representing a historic commitment to openness and transparency. <p>"it's disappointing that senator (candidate last) and his campaign decided to decline this proposal. apparently they would rather contrive a political issue than foster a genuine discussion about the future of our country. </p><p>"senator (candidate last) believes that the american people deserve an open and accessible debate as they choose between real change and four more years of failed bush policies, and he welcomed (candidate last)'s invitation to offer voters 'the rare opportunity of witnessing candidates for the highest office in the land discuss civilly and extensively the great issues at stake in the election,'" said (candidate last) campaign manager david plouffe.</p></span>
