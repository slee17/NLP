<span class="displaytext">lincoln, neb. - audra ostergard, associate chair of the nebraska (PARTY NAME) party and member of the (PARTY NAME) national committee, publicly announced her support for senator (candidate full) in the race for the (PARTY NAME) presidential nomination. <p>"i have carefully weighed input from (PARTY NAME) across nebraska and closely watched results from primaries and caucuses across the country," said ostergard. "there are compelling arguments for supporting both candidates, but my decision came down to what's best for our country and for nebraska. in that regard, i am confident in my decision to endorse senator (candidate last). he has a proven ability to activate (PARTY NAME) in nebraska." </p><p>"the gravity of this decision has weighed on me heavily," ostergard added. "i don't want to use my position to influence the process, but at the same time i agree with howard dean that our party needs a nominee. senator (candidate last)'s prohibitive lead in pledged delegates was a major factor in my decision." </p><p>ostergard, 41, is a publishing representative in lincoln. by virtue of her position as associate chair in the nebraska (PARTY NAME) party, she is a member of the (PARTY NAME) national committee and therefore automatically a delegate to the (PARTY NAME) party's national convention in august. </p><p>all six of nebraska's unpledged party leaders and elected official delegates (also known as "superdelegates") have now endorsed senator (candidate last). u.s. senator ben nelson, committeman vince powers, committeewoman kathleen fahey, and committeman frank la mere all endorsed prior to nebraska's february 9th caucus. ndp chairman steve achelpohl announced his support last week.</p></span>
