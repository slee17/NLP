<span class="displaytext">this mother's day, i'll be doing what so many other americans are doing - spending time with my family and thinking about the mothers in my life. my mother, ann dunham, was the kindest, most generous spirit i have ever known, and what is best in me, i owe to her. my grandmother, madelyn dunham, helped raise me, sacrificed again and again for me, and loves me as much as she loves anything in this world. and the mother of my daughters sasha and malia - my wife michelle - is the rock of the (candidate last) family and a woman who continues to make me a better person. we couldn't have done this year without my mother-in-law marian robinson, who stays with our girls while michelle and i are on the campaign trail. and my two sisters, auma and maya, each the mother to young daughters, are not only my family, but my dear friends. so to the mothers in my life and to the mothers in all our lives, happy mother's day.</span>
