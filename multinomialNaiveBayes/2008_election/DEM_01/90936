<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- senator (candidate full) today released the following statement on the 35th anniversary of the roe v. wade decision. <p>"thirty-five years after the supreme court decided roe v. wade, it's never been more important to protect a woman's right to choose. last year, the supreme court decided by a vote of 5-4 to uphold the federal abortion ban, and in doing so undermined an important principle of roe v. wade: that we must always protect women's health. with one more vacancy on the supreme court, we could be looking at a majority hostile to a women's fundamental right to choose for the first time since roe v. wade. the next president may be asked to nominate that supreme court justice. that is what is at stake in this election.</p><p>"throughout my career, i've been a consistent and strong supporter of reproductive justice, and have consistently had a 100% pro-choice rating with planned parenthood and naral pro-choice america. </p><p>"when south dakota passed a law banning all abortions in a direct effort to have roe overruled, i was the only candidate for president to raise money to help the citizens of south dakota repeal that law. when anti-choice protesters blocked the opening of an illinois planned parenthood clinic in a community where affordable health care is in short supply, i was the only candidate for president who spoke out against it. and i will continue to defend this right by passing the freedom of choice act as president. </p><p>"moreover, i believe in and have supported common-sense solutions like increasing access to affordable birth control to help prevent unintended pregnancies. in the illinois state senate, when congress failed to require insurance plans to cover fda-approved contraceptives, i made sure those contraceptives were covered for women in illinois. in the u.s. senate, i've worked with senator claire mccaskill (d-mo) on a bill that would make birth control more affordable for low-income and college women, and introduced the senate version of representative hilda solis' bill to reduce unintended pregnancies in communities of color. as president, i will improve access to affordable health care and work to ensure that our teens are getting the information and services they need to stay safe and healthy. </p><p>"but we also know that roe v. wade is about more than a woman's right to choose; it's about equality. it's about whether our daughters are going to have the same opportunities as our sons. and so to truly honor that decision, we need to update the social contract so that women can free themselves, and their children, from violent relationships; so that a mom can stay home with a sick child without getting a pink slip; so that she can go to work knowing that there's affordable, quality childcare for her children; and so that the american dream is within reach for every family in this country. this anniversary reminds us that it's not enough to protect the gains of the past â€” we have to build a future that's filled with hope and possibility for all americans."</p></span>
