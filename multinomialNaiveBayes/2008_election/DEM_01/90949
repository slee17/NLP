<span class="displaytext">chicago, il--senator (candidate last) today released the following statement in response to president bush's announcement of sanctions on the sudanese government. <p>"president bush's announcement today that he will finally impose tightened sanctions on the sudanese government is welcome. but, it falls well short of what is necessary to compel khartoum to stop the four year-old genocide." </p><p>"conspicuously absent from this package of sanctions is maximal punitive action against the sudanese oil industry, which the administration once touted as a critical element of its so-called "plan b." targeted pressure by the international community against the sudanese oil economy is a much-needed step to stop the killing and displacement of innocent civilians in darfur." </p><p>"also needed is the deployment of a strong international force, led by the un, with an enforcement mandate to protect civilians. the u.s. should work with our allies and partners to compel the sudanese government to accept such a force and establish a no-fly zone over darfur."</p></span>
