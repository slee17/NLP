[walter isaacson, president of the aspen institute.] </i></p><p><i>"across the country, social entrepreneurs are achieving real results in solving the nation's social problems, and with greater efficiency and impact than traditional approaches. senator (candidate last)'s plan will help call attention to the important work happening outside of washington to address the domestic challenges we face and foster even more innovation in the nonprofit sector."</i> [kelly ward, director of america forward] </p><p><i>"speaking as an educator and former foundation executive, i am particularly impressed by the service learning component of senator (candidate last)'s plan for universal voluntary citizen service. a structured student service learning experience in high school and college enhances the teaching/learning process by both stimulating student academic aspirations and nurturing a sense of responsibility to serve the public good. these are powerful ingredients for the success of our educational institutions as well as america's civic culture. i heartily endorse what senator (candidate last) is seeking to accomplish for our nation." </i>[don stewart, former president of spelman college; former president of the college board; former president of the chicago community trust] </p><p><i>"as someone who has served in the united states army and the house of representatives, i applaud senator (candidate last)'s push for national service. by boosting the number of people who work in classrooms, clean up our environment, assist veterans and respond to national emergencies, president (candidate last) will engage americans, so that together we can tackle the challenges of the 21st century." </i>[congressman patrick murphy (d-pa)] </p><p><i>"(candidate full) has put together a bold and comprehensive plan to expand service opportunities to all populations and key public issues through a variety of public agencies at home and abroad. it builds on organizational strengths, draws on americans' deep and widespread desire to serve, and will create momentum toward a unified society of people from all walks of life and all backgrounds offering their best to their country and to the world. it will support creativity and replicate innovative initiatives in the non-profit sector; it will take successful programs to scale toward ending poverty and despair. the implementation of this plan would liberate wonderful energy throughout our beloved nation. many thanks for offering this vision." </i>[dorothy stoneman, president and founder of youthbuild usa] </p><p><i>"(candidate full) and michelle (candidate last) understand from their own lives the transformative impact of service. they also know the difference that citizens can make tackling difficult challenges in their own communities. (candidate last)'s plan for universal voluntary citizen service takes an idea that has earned bipartisan support and grows it to a new level so that citizens serving citizens, both at home and abroad, will be the new hallmark of american democracy." </i>[alan d. solomont, (candidate last) appointee to the board of the corporation for national and community service (2000-2004); recently reappointed to the bipartisan board by president bush.] </p><p><i>''senator (candidate last) is wise to renew and reinvigorate america's call to citizen service and to look outside washington d.c. for proven solutions to america's toughest challenges. throughout american history, american social entrepreneurs have invented and begun to expand effective innovations that solve problems. the volunteer fire department, settlement houses, community development corporations, and after-school learning programs were all developed by american social entrepreneurs and fueled by a creative combination of citizen volunteerism and strategic government investment; too much of what government currently funds does not work well. senator (candidate last)'s call for a public-private partnership that looks outside washington for proven and well-evaluated solutions and then brings these specific solutions to scale is an important way to increase american competitiveness and increase access to the american dream.''</i> [eric schwarz, president and ceo of citizen schools]</p><p><i>"service in our communities is in (candidate full)'s dna. it is central to his experience. it is not surprising that he has made this issue a priority and approaches it with sincerity, commitment and imagination." </i>[richard danzig, fellow at the center for new american security and the center for strategic and international studies; former secretary of the navy; co-author of the 1986 ford foundation financed study: national service: what would it mean?]</p><p><i>"september 11, 2001 united americans. young and old, rural and urban, (PARTY NAME) and (PARTY NAME), we each yearned to serve our country. we hoped to be part of something bigger than ourselves and to play a small role in tackling formidable 21st century challenges. unfortunately we were not summoned -- until today. (candidate full) understands that the conventional approach of solving problems from washington won't cut it. he understands that the best weapons we have to combat terrorism, poverty, and global warming are the ingenuity, industriousness, and spirit of the american people. (candidate last) is the first national leader who has the power to inspire people to sacrifice and the rigor to maximize its impact." </i>[samantha power, founder of the carr center for human rights policy at harvard university] </p><p><i>"with the right amount of political commitment and public investment, social entrepreneurship has the potential to be as vital to the strength of our society as business entrepreneurship is to the strength of our economy. social entrepreneurs and the programs they represent have on-the-ground results. they can show, in very human and tangible ways, how they are delivering results every day, child by child, community by community. senator (candidate last)'s plan makes an important step forward in recognizing this work and improving the way we solve problems in this country." </i> [kim syman, managing partner of new profit inc., director of the action tank] </p><p>all affiliations are included for identification purposes only.</p></span>
