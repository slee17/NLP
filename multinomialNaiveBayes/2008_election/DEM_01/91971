<span class="displaytext"><i>cites (candidate last)'s positive vision for change, says he was turned off by recent negative attacks</i> <p>manchester, nh -- nationally acclaimed documentarian and walpole resident ken burns endorsed senator<br/> (candidate full)'s presidential bid today. burns, who had planned to stay neutral in the race, said<br/> that recent attacks against (candidate last) prompted him to declare his support and cemented his belief that<br/> (candidate last) is the only candidate in the race who can put an end to the "slash-and-burn character attacks"<br/> that have prevented progress on the challenges we face. </p><p>"i had intended to remain neutral throughout the new hampshire primary process, but find i can no<br/> longer do so. recent events compel me to declare my support for and to endorse senator (candidate full)<br/> for president. i do so for several reasons. at a time when the political winds were pushing this<br/> country into an unnecessary and unwise war, (candidate full) had the judgment-and the political and<br/> moral courage-to oppose it. at a time when our politics has descended into cynical, slash-and-burn<br/> character attacks, (candidate full) has steadfastly presented a positive, unironic, agenda for this<br/> country. when others find themselves mired in the consequences of their past actions, and spend<br/> their time arguing the past, he is presenting a vision of the future, a vision that is not only<br/> possible but essential to our survival as a great nation. </p><p>"we, as a nation, are at a crossroads. we need a president who is authentic, who points us to that<br/> future, and a leader who calls upon each and every one of us to heed the 'better angels of our<br/> nature' and not our basest fears. (candidate full) will be that kind of president. it is time for a real<br/> change." </p><p>burns has been making films for more than twenty years and is widely respected as one of the leading<br/> artistic and historiographical voices in the country. his documentaries include, among many others,<br/> the civil war, baseball, jazz, and most recently, the war.</p></span>
