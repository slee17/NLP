<span class="displaytext">reno, nv -- (candidate full) made the following statement today on the ongoing negotiations between culinary workers union local 226 and the grand sierra resort in reno.<p>"what we are fighting for is making real the idea that in this country, we value the labor of every american. we will not achieve success for all workers until we have fair contracts that make it possible for workers to achieve the american dream. no worker wants to put their family in the situation of going out on strike, but the culinary workers in reno have fought hard for the standard they have set and will continue to fight to protect it. i have pledged my support for the culinary workers and i'll be there with them until every worker has a fair contract."</p></span>
