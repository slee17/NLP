<span class="displaytext">washington, d.c. - u.s. senator (candidate full) (d-il) today released the following statement on his vote on the supplemental appropriations bill:<p>"this vote is a choice between validating the same failed policy in iraq that has cost us so many lives and demanding a new one. and i am demanding a new one." </p><p>"we must fund our troops. but we owe them something more. we owe them a clear, prudent plan to relieve them of the burden of policing someone else's civil war. we need a plan to compel the iraqi people to reach a political accommodation and to take responsibility for their own future. it's time to change course." </p><p>"i opposed this war in 2002 precisely because i feared it would lead us to the open-ended occupation in which we find ourselves today." </p><p>"this president has led us down a disastrous path and has arrogantly refused to acknowledge the grim reality of this war, which has cost us so dearly in lives and treasure." </p><p>"after he vetoed a plan that would have funded the troops and begun to bring them home, this bill represents more of his stubborn refusal to address his failed policy." </p><p>"we should not give the president a blank check to continue down this same, disastrous path." </p><p>"with my vote today, i am saying to the president that enough is enough. we must negotiate a better plan that funds our troops, signals to the iraqis that it is time for them to act and that begins to bring our brave servicemen and women home safely and responsibly."</p></span>
