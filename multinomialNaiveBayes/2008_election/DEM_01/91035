<span class="displaytext">chicago, il - "i welcome the results of today's emergency summit of european union leaders in brussels. the eu made clear, as i have repeatedly insisted, that georgia's territorial integrity must be respected, that russia's recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states must be rejected, that the six-point peace plan of august 12 must be implemented in its entirety, and that georgia must be given substantial humanitarian and economic assistance. i applaud the eu's decision to postpone talks on a new eu-russia partnership until russia fully honors its commitments. i also applaud the eu's decisions to send civilian monitors to georgia as part of the necessary international monitoring mechanism provided for in the cease-fire agreement, and to sponsor an international conference to assist reconstruction in georgia. <p>"together with european and other partners, we must hold russia accountable for its actions and stand united in support of a europe in which all states can freely determine their foreign policies and alliances and in which the rule of law is respected."</p></span>
