"that [taking credit] implies that i opened the eyes of folks in altgeld [on this issue] and that's not true.

[dreams from my father, p.167] </p><p>(candidate last) saw parallels between his personal story and altgeld resident. "sometimes i would stop by mary's house just to say hello, drawn perhaps by the loneliness i sensed there, and the easy parallels between my own mother and mary; and between myself and mary's daughters, such sweet and pretty girls whose lives were so much more difficult than mine had ever been, with grandparents who shunned them, black classmates who teased them, all the poison in the air."
