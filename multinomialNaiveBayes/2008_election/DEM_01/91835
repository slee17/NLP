<span class="displaytext">austin, tx - the (candidate last) campaign today announced that jim hightower endorsed senator (candidate last)'s campaign to change politics in washington, d.c. and turn the page on the divisive politics of the past. <p>raised in denison, texas, jim hightower is a syndicated columnist, national radio commentator, and was twice elected texas agriculture commissioner. today he released the following statement: </p><p>"the most exciting thing about the (candidate last) phenomenon is the phenomenon—the fact that millions of grassroots americans have self-organized and become the driving force in a presidential campaign. they feel that they matter again in politics and that some real progress might finally be at hand. </p><p>in 2006, an awakened political majority tried to send an electoral message demanding real change in washington's business-as-usual, money-driven policies. they "won," but were disappointed by the new (PARTY NAME) leadership in congress, so this year, they're back with an even more vociferous, insistent, message of change—and they've found their messenger in (candidate full). </p><p>i believe he will win the nomination and win in november, but most importantly, i believe he can govern as a progressive president. this is because (candidate last) will not be going into the white house alone or with the usual coterie of special interests and old party operatives—rather, the (PARTY NAME) force that he has excited at the grassroots (especially among energized young people) will go in with him, demanding progressive policies and providing a counterpunch to the lobbyists who will try to capture his presidency. </p><p>senator (candidate last) represents the bright future that is possible in america when ordinary people begin to take charge. (candidate last) and (candidate last) certainly have a wealth of washington experience, but (candidate last) has tapped into our country's enormous (PARTY NAME) potential, and that's not merely exciting, it is invaluable to our future."</p></span>
