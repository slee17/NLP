<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- u.s. senator (candidate full) released the following statement today on the release of haleh esfandiari from iran. <p>"i join haleh esfandiari's family and friends in welcoming her departure from iran after months of harassment and over 100 days of detention. it is outrageous that what began as a journey to visit and care for her 93 year old mother became such a terrible ordeal. it is time for the iranian government to release all of the innocent iranian-americans who are still detained within iran, and to uphold the principles of respect and dialogue that have been haleh's life work. this sad episode reminds us that the united states must stand as a principled voice around the world on behalf of justice for heroes like haleh esfandiari who are detained without cause."</p></span>
