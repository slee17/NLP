<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- u.s. senator (candidate full) released the following statement on the feingold-reid legislation. <p>"we don't have to wait until george bush is out of office to end the war in iraq. the american people are tired of losing our sons and daughters to iraq's civil war and spending billions of dollars every week on the wrong policy. we're tired of setting back our security and neglecting pressing priorities at home and around the world. it's time to stop giving president bush a blank check for a war that should never have been fought. the feingold-reid legislation starts the responsible redeployment of our troops out of iraq's civil war, and sets a hard end date to conclude that drawdown. this is the best policy for our troops, and for pressing iraq's leaders to finally get serious about resolving their differences. i have opposed this war from the beginning. i will continue to urge my colleagues to support legislation that sets a direction out of iraq, and a deadline to complete our drawdown. i will continue to urge americans to press their senators and representatives to come together to end this war."</p></span>
