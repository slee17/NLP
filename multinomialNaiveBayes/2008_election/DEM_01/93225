(candidate last) pointed out that senator (candidate last) is pursuing the calculated strategy advocated by washington insiders by refusing to discuss her views about social security during the last televised presidential debate. <p>"you might remember this came up at the last presidential debate," (candidate last) said. "and when senator (candidate last) was asked about it, she wouldn't say what she thinks we should do. and the other day, here in iowa, she skipped another chance to give a direct answer on this. she's not alone in ducking the issue, of course. because conventional thinking in washington says social security is the third rail of american politics. it says you should hedge, dodge, and spin, but at all costs, don't answer." </p><p>on sunday, (candidate last)'s campaign began airing a television ad in iowa yesterday highlighting his belief that social security won't be strengthened until washington politicians stop treating it as the so-called third rail of american politics. you can view the new ad at: <a href="http://iowa.(candidate full).com/iawind">www.iowa.(candidate full).com/iawind</a>. </p><p>"if we have failed to have a real, honest conversation about social security, it will not get fixed," (candidate last) says in the new ad. "this is a program that millions of people depend on." </p><p>(candidate last) first drew the distinction between his commitment to speaking honestly about social security and senator (candidate last)'s strategy of dodging direct questions on the topic at a town hall meeting with seniors in des moines on saturday. at the event, (candidate last) was introduced by previously undecided caucusgoer tod bowman, a maquoketa high school teacher who said he was disappointed that senator (candidate last) refused to directly answer his question about strengthening social security at a town hall meeting she'd hosted earlier this month. </p><p>bowman said of senator (candidate last), "it made me wonder, if a candidate won't answer a question on the campaign trail, how can we be sure she'll be honest with the american people when they're president?" </p></span>
