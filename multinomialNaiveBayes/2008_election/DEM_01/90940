<span class="displaytext">"today's news is a tragic reminder of the staggering and ongoing costs of the iraq war, particularly on our troops and their families. we are more than five years into this war, and the pentagon and va are still unprepared to treat the unseen wounds of battle. we know that incidence of psychological injury increase with each additional tour of duty in iraq, and that our troops are not getting the support they need. too many are falling through the cracks because they need help but feel they can't get it. when i am president, we'll hire more mental health professionals, increase training to recognize the signs and to reject the stigma of seeking care, and enhance mental health screening and treatment from enlistment, to deployment, to reentry into civilian life. it's time to serve our troops as well as they have served us."</span>
