<span class="displaytext"><b>o'reilly:</b> i want you to react to a couple of stats that i pulled out of here. you are a big tax the rich guy, aren't you? <p><b>(candidate last):</b> just you, bill. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> i know… </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> i think you're making too much money, man. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> you and hillary both, you just want to take my money, and you can have it. i mean, i don't care if i live in a hut. under president bush, the federal government derived 20 percent more revenue than under president (candidate last). did you know that? </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> well… </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> did you know that? </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> ...the economy grew, bill. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> it grew, that's right. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> the economy grew, so of course, the… </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> under president bush, the economy grew 19 percent more than (candidate last). see, this is what i'm not getting with you (PARTY NAME). </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> no, no, no. hold on a second, bill. wait, bill, hold on a second now. i mean, you know the famous saying about there are lies, damn lies, and statistics? </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> yes. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> well, you and i can — we can play a statistics game. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> i know it's bull. i know it is. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> so let's be clear on the record, ok? the — during the bush administration… </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> yes. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> ...there was economic growth. not as fast as during the 1990s, ok, but there was growth during the bush administration. but what happened was that wages and incomes for ordinary americans, the guys who watch your show… </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> yes. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> …the guys who you advocate for and you speak for on this show… </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> right. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> …their wages and incomes did not go up. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> why? </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> they went down. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> do you know why? </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> and the reason they went down… </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> yes. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> ...is because most of the corporate profits and increased productivity went to the top, not just one percent, but the top one-tenth of a percent. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> well, let me submit to you that you're wrong. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> and part of… </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> ok. we've been studying this issue because we want to be fair and balanced and give all sides. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> right. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> t he reason that wages have been depressed — and they're not that much. it's about $400 or $500 for the bush administration, real wages up, and about $2,000 under the (candidate last) administration — is because there are 10 million immigrants, new immigrants in the workforce, most of whom are illegal aliens. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> bill… </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> those 10 million… </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> i totally disagree. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> ...with their salaries. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> yes. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> ...have brought down — but again, that's statistics. let's get back to taxing the rich. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> so let me just finish making my point. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> all right. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> the fact is for people in your income bracket and mine… </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> right. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> ...now, we both come from humble beginnings. and we were talking before the show that the fact that only in america could we have this success. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> absolutely. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> and i am not somebody who begrudges that success. i want people… </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> but you want 50 percent of my success. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> no, i don't. no, i don't. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> that's your tax rate, 50. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> what i… </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> ...if you get elected… </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> what i have said is that i would take your marginal rate back to what it was under bill (candidate last). </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> yes, 39. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> you go back to 39. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> right. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> you can afford that. that's point no. 1. in exchange, i'm cutting taxes for 95 percent of americans. 95 percent. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> that's swell, but that's class warfare. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> it's not. ninety-five percent is not class warfare. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> and then — whoa, whoa, whoa. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> what i'm saying is that 95 percent of the american people are getting a tax break three times the amount of tax relief under my plan than (candidate full)'s — and that's not my statistic. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> here's where i got a problem. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> that's from independent analysts. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> and it's not all about me, believe me. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> go ahead. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> twenty percent more revenue coming in under bush than (candidate last), all right? he cuts taxes, people invest more. he cuts the capital gains. the government gets 20 percent more than under (candidate last). you want to raise it back up. it doesn't make sense. </p><p>secondly, the payroll tax. over $250, you are going to hike it to infinity. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> i am not. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> what's the cap? </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> that's not true. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> whoa, whoa, whoa. what's the cap? </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> all i've said is that after $250… </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> yes? </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> ...right, then we could raise the cap. not… </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> we could or we will? </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> what i have said is that if we've got a set of options to stabilize social security, which i think is important, and i think you do, too. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> right. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> because there are millions of seniors out there who depend on it. and we've got a couple of options. we could raise the retirement age or no. 2, we could cut benefits. try living on social security right now. that's no fun if you're a senior. no. 3, we could just do nothing, in which case in the out years, social security will be — let me finish my point, bill. in the out years, it's going to be essentially a reduction in benefits. we could raise the payroll tax on everybody. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> don't do that. i don't mind you... </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> there is no free lunch. so my only point is… </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> no, there is a free lunch. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> what is the free lunch? </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> the free lunch is that you're taking the wealthy in america and the big earners, ok, you're taking money away from them and you're giving it to people who don't. that's called income redistribution. it's a socialist tenant. come on, you know that. you went to harvard. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> teddy roosevelt supported a progressive income tax. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> not at the level you do. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> bill, i don't like paying taxes. you think i like writing a check? what i believe is that there's certain things we've got to do. and we've got to help people who are having a tough time affording college so they can benefit like we benefited from this great country. people who are have having a tough time; they don't have health care. people who are trying to figure out how they are going to pay the bills. and there are certain things we've got to do. our infrastructure — look what happened in beijing. you go to the olympics and these folks are building, and we've got sewer lines that are crumbling. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> ok. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> and at a certain point, we've got to pay for it. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> you're not across the board-ing it. you're going, i'm taking from the rich. i'm robin hood (candidate last). </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> bill… </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> and i'm giving to everybody else. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> all i'm saying is… </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> and then you want to raise corporate taxes. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> no, i don't. that's not true. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> you want — you don't want… </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> all i'm saying is, if we've got something that we've got to pay for — under george bush, the debt has gone up $4 trillion. right? so that's a credit card we're taking out on our kids from the bank of china that they're going to have to pay. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> war on terror, though, come on. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> well, no, no, no, that's not true. that has to do in part with the bush tax cuts and no cuts in spending. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> all right. you can't — bush tax cuts generated more income. the spending is out of control. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> the bush record, the numbers are what they are. $4 trillion. now we've got a choice. we can keep on just borrowing and dump it on our kids. that's option no. 1. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> you can take it from the wealthy and give it to everybody else. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> or we could have across the board tax hikes, what you just talked about. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> it's not income redistribution. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> well, but the problem is, if i am sitting pretty, and you've got a waitress who is making minimum wage plus tips, and i can afford it if she can't, what's the big deal for me to say i'm going to pay a little bit more? </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> because it inhibits… </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> that is neighborliness. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> listen, if you raise the cap gains tax, that's going to inhibit investment. i won't buy as many stocks. and many, many, more people won't, ok, that's… </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> if we went up… </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> it's going to come back to bite you, senator. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> if we went up to a prohibitive rate, you're right. but look… </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> thirty percent on — that's vegas, man. i'm not going with those odds. fifteen i'll pay. not 30. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> i didn't do to — i didn't say we would go to that. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> you said between 25 and 28. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> no, what we said is let's say we go up to 20. i've talked to… </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> twenty is ok, not 25. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> well, you and i agree. </p><p><b>o'reilly:</b> all right. </p><p><i>(end of part two)</i></p></span>
