<span class="displaytext">chicago, il - "i deplore and condemn the vicious attacks perpetrated in new delhi this weekend, which left 21 innocent people dead and nearly 100 wounded. these cowardly acts of mass murder are a stark reminder that india continues to suffer from the scourge of terrorism on a scale few other nations can imagine. i urge all countries to cooperate with indian authorities in tracking down the perpetrators of this outrage. my thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families." </span>
