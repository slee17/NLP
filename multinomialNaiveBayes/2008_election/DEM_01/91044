<span class="displaytext">below is a statement from senator (candidate last) on the 73rd anniversary of social security: <p>"on this anniversary of social security, let's reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that social security remains a safety net that seniors can count on today, tomorrow, and always. it is impossible to fully measure social security's value for its recipients, as well as for those who look after and love them. nearly 13 million seniors depend on it each month to keep from falling into poverty, and millions more depend on survivor and disability benefits to protect their retirement. </p><p>"as president, i will protect social security for today's seniors and future generations. that means strengthening social security's solvency while protecting middle class families from benefit cuts, tax increases or increases in the retirement age. it means treating social security not as a political football or describing it as an "absolute disgrace," but instead honoring it as the cornerstone of the social compact in this country. and it means opposing efforts to privatize social security, as i did when president bush proposed risky private accounts a few years ago. privatization is wrong and tears at the fabric of social security - the very idea of mutual responsibility - by subjecting a secure, earned retirement to the whims of the market. the bush privatization plan that senator (candidate last) now embraces would tell millions of elderly americans that they're on their own, putting them at risk of falling into poverty. that's not what this country is about. </p><p>"it's time to reclaim the idea that in this country, we're all in it together. that is america's very promise - and social security's very guarantee. and it requires a president who will change the ways of washington, protect the people's interests, and bring americans together to meet the great challenges of our time. that is exactly the sort of leadership i intend to offer," said senator (candidate full).</p></span>
