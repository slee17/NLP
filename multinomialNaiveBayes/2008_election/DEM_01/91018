"on any given night in america, while we go to sleep in our homes, there are hundreds of thousands of americans who have fought for our freedom who go without their own home. veterans make up 11 percent of america's adult population, but 26 percent of the homeless population. already, we are seeing homeless vets from the wars in iraq and afghanistan. that's just not right. that's just not who we are as a country." </p><p>(candidate last), who sits on the senate veterans' affairs committee, has passed legislation to expand and improve services for homeless veterans including increasing rental vouchers to bring homeless veterans off the street, expanding treatment for veterans with mental illnesses, and facilitating transfer of property from the veterans' administration to homeless shelters.

"that's the principle that we need when it comes to homeless vets. that is what i have fought for in the senate. and that is why i have recently introduced the veterans homelessness prevention act, so that our vets have the skills and tools that they need to build a life after their service. this is not a partisan issue. this is a moral obligation. when i am president, we will not leave any of our veterans behind." </p><p>as president, (candidate last) will maintain a zero-tolerance policy for homeless veterans. the (candidate last) plan would: </p><p>* increase access to long-term, affordable housing for veterans and their families<br/> * focus on preventing homeless by targeting at-risk populations with housing supportive services<br/> * expand rental assistance programs to get homeless veterans off the streets<br/> * create a special assistant for veterans affairs within the department of housing and urban development. </p><p>in addition to his work on veteran homelessness, (candidate last) has compiled a track record of standing up for veterans on a range of issues. his accomplishments include: </p><p>* (candidate last) passed legislation in the u.s. senate to improve care and slash red tape for our returning wounded warriors and their families who face deplorable conditions at places like walter reed army medical center. <br/> * (candidate last) passed a bill to give family members health care while they care for wounded troops and introduced legislation to provide them a year of job protection, so they never have to choose between caring for a loved one and keeping a job.<br/> * (candidate last) passed laws to provide comprehensive supports to homeless veterans.<br/> * (candidate last) led a bipartisan effort in the senate to try to halt the military's unfair practice of discharging service members for having a service-connected psychological injury.<br/> * (candidate last) passed an amendment to give recovering service members free meals and free telephone calls at military hospitals. <br/> * (candidate last) passed legislation to stop a va review of closed ptsd cases that could have led to a reduction in veterans' benefits.<br/> * (candidate last) passed an amendment to ensure that all service members returning from iraq are properly screened for traumatic brain injury (tbi). </p><p>read more of senator (candidate last)'s plan to keep our sacred trust with veterans <a href="http://(candidate last).3cdn.net/1c6fcae0c8b4395a45_n2wimv3fq.pdf">here</a>.</p></span>
