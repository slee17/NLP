<span class="displaytext">from the beginning, we've urged you to think of this as your campaign; to contribute your ideas, energy and creativity to the mission of ending a war, challenging our broken politics and changing our course. <p>we know the energy for such change will only come from the grassroots -- from you -- not from washington. </p><p>you're response has been amazing. hundreds of thousands of americans, young and old, signing up, organizing, everyday growing this movement for a new politics and a new course for our country. </p><p>i've been particularly inspired by the countless creative homemade videos that have cropped on our site and others, capturing the essence of barack, the campaign and your hopes for the future. </p><p>we welcome and encourage these works, which can help carry our message farther and wider, giving people a deeper sense of what this is all about. </p><p>and what this is about -- in part -- is a new politics of hope, not fear; a politics that stresses our stake in each other, rather than one that divides and inflames. </p><p>at the end of the day, each of you will decide how best to express yourselves in the town square of the internet, which is helping to rekindle america's civic life. </p><p>as you do, i urge you to continue to keep it positive -- on what we can achieve together to change our politics and steer it away from the destructive tactics that have dominated washington and our elections for too long. </p><p>thanks for all your great efforts. </p><p>david plouffe<br/> campaign manager</p></span>
