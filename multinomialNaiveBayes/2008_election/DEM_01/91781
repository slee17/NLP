(candidate last) is 163 delegates away from securing the (PARTY NAME) nomination. </p><p>espinoza said, "i am endorsing (candidate full) today because throughout this process i have seen him show a judgment and character that we need in our next president. from day one he opposed the iraq war and has a plan to end the war in a responsible way and bring our sons and daughters home. he has shown he has the character to lead our great nation, from his choice to spend his career serving people in the poorest communities in chicago to his commitment to speaking truth to the american people, even when it isn't politically convenient to do so. to unify the country at this time in our history we need a president who has these qualities, and that is why i am proud to endorse him today. my good friend (candidate full), who backed (candidate last) some weeks ago, knows what it takes to lead and i trust his judgment in this decision as well. i look forward to working with this great movement to bring victory in november."</p></span>
