<span class="displaytext">chicago, il- senator (candidate full) today released the following statement on the anniversary of the "mission accomplished" speech. <p>"four years after president bush landed on an aircraft carrier and declared 'mission accomplished,' we are still in a war where more than one hundred american service members have died in just the month of april. we grieve for them today and urge the president to avoid making another tragic mistake by signing the bill that will end this war and bring our troops home. " </p><p>"we are now one signature away from ending this war. the majority of the american people and their congress now agree that there is no military solution to the conflict in iraq, and that the best way to pressure the warring factions to reach a political settlement that can end this war is still a phased withdrawal of american forces with the goal of removing all combat brigades from iraq by march 30<sup>th</sup>, 2008. it is time to end this war so we can bring our troops home and redeploy our forces to help fight the broader struggle against terrorism and other threats of this new century."</p></span>
