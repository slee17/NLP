<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- u.s. senator (candidate full) today released the following statement on the failed schip vote in the u.s. house of representatives. <p>"four million american children were denied basic health coverage today because washington politicians failed to stand up to this president's disgraceful veto. at a time when we're spending billions of dollars on a war that never should've been authorized and giving billions in tax breaks to the wealthiest americans, washington's failure shows a callousness of priorities that is offensive to the ideals we hold as americans. </p><p>when i am president, i will sign a universal health care bill into law by the end of my first term that will cover every american and cut costs more dramatically than any other plan offered by a candidate in this race. and i'll do it by bringing (PARTY NAME)s and (PARTY NAME) together, like i did when i expanded health care for an additional 150,000 children and their parents as an illinois state senator."</p></span>
