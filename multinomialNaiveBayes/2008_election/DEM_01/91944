<span class="displaytext">chicago, il-- senator (candidate full) today unveils his plan to ensure that<br/> americans with disabilities have an equal opportunity to achieve the<br/> american dream and pledged to make implementing this plan an (candidate last)<br/> administration priority. <p>in a video released on his web site, (candidate last) said: " <a href="http://my.(candidate full).com/empowering">we must build a world<br/> free of unnecessary barriers, stereotypes, and discrimination</a>," and<br/> "policies must be developed, attitudes must be shaped, and buildings and<br/> organizations must be designed to ensure that everyone has a chance to<br/> get the education they need and live independently as full citizens in<br/> their communities." </p><p>despite the federal government's promise to shoulder 40 percent of each<br/> state's "excess cost" of educating children with disabilities, it has<br/> never lived up to this obligation. restrictive supreme court decisions<br/> have undermined the force of the americans with disabilities act and the<br/> employment rate of workers with disabilities continues to lag behind<br/> other workers. and recent reports show that the social security<br/> administration's inability to deal with its backlog of disability claims<br/> has cost individuals their homes and economic security. </p><p>(candidate full) believes the united states should lead the world in<br/> empowering people with disabilities to take full advantage of their<br/> talents and become independent, integrated members of society. in<br/> addition to reclaiming america's global leadership on this issue by<br/> becoming a signatory to — and having the senate ratify — the un<br/> convention on the rights of persons with disabilities, (candidate last)'s plan has<br/> four parts that are designed to provide americans with disabilities with<br/> the greatest possible access to the same opportunities as those without<br/> disabilities. </p><p>click <a href="http://www.(candidate full).com/pdf/disabilityplanfactsheet.pdf">here</a> to view a fact sheet on senator (candidate last)'s plan and <a href="http://my.(candidate full).com/empowering">here</a> to view<br/> the web ad. </p><p>they are: </p><p>first, provide americans with disabilities the educational opportunities<br/> they need to succeed. (candidate last) will: </p><p>* fund the individuals with disabilities education act so that students<br/> with disabilities will get the public education they have a right to; </p><p>* ensure that all states have the support to adopt comprehensive newborn<br/> screening programs and set a national goal to provide voluntary<br/> re-screening for all two-year-olds — the age at which some conditions,<br/> including autism spectrum disorders, begin to appear; </p><p>* expand early head start to serve more children with disabilities and<br/> spur states, through (candidate last)'s early learning challenge grants, to expand<br/> programs for children with disabilities, such as idea part c, and<br/> integrate these programs with other early childhood programs; and </p><p>* help more students with disabilities attend college by funding<br/> vocational rehabilitation programs to provide better counseling and<br/> offering a new, fully refundable $4,000 american opportunity tax credit<br/> to make college more affordable. </p><p>second, <b>end discrimination and promote equal opportunity</b>. (candidate last)<br/> will: </p><p>* restore the americans with disabilities act by supporting legislation<br/> reversing supreme court decisions that have narrowed it and appointing a<br/> judiciary that will respect congressional intent; </p><p>* fully fund and increase staffing at the equal employment opportunity<br/> commission and the office of federal contract compliance programs so<br/> they have the resources to enforce anti-discrimination laws that protect<br/> workers with disabilities; </p><p>* secure affordable, quality, portable health care for all by the end of<br/> his first term in office so people with disabilities can enter and/or<br/> re-enter the workforce without fear of losing their government-provided<br/> health insurance; and </p><p>* support mental health parity so that coverage for serious mental<br/> illnesses is provided on the same terms and conditions as other<br/> illnesses and diseases. (candidate last) passed illinois' mental health parity law<br/> as a state senator. </p><p>third, <b>increase the employment rate of workers with disabilities</b>.<br/> towards that end, the (candidate last) plan would, among other things: </p><p>* increase the number of federal employees with disabilities and require<br/> the hiring of an additional 100,000 federal employees with disabilities<br/> within five years. </p><p>* provide workers with disabilities and caregivers with greater<br/> workplace flexibility by expanding the family and medical leave act,<br/> mandating seven days of paid sick leave for all workers, and encouraging<br/> states to provide paid leave, and also by protecting caregivers from<br/> workplace discrimination; and </p><p>* encourage more hiring of workers with disabilities in the private<br/> sector, including by educating employers about best practices in<br/> accommodating workers with disabilities and the availability of tax<br/> benefits for providing accommodations, including the disabled access tax<br/> credit, the tax deduction for architectural and transportation barrier<br/> removal, and the work opportunity tax credit. </p><p>and fourth, <b>support independent, community-based living</b> for<br/> americans with disabilities. to further this end, (candidate last) will, among<br/> other things: </p><p>* streamline the current application and appeals processes to reduce the<br/> unacceptable delays experienced by individuals applying for social<br/> security disability benefits, and ensure that the ssa has the funding it<br/> needs to hire additional judges and staff and to invest in technology to<br/> expedite final decisions; </p><p>* assure that americans with disabilities' right to choose the most<br/> appropriate setting in which to live, affirmed in olmstead v. l.c., is<br/> fully vindicated; </p><p>* support the community choice act and direct care workers so that<br/> americans with significant disabilities have the choice to live in their<br/> community rather than a nursing home or other institution; </p><p>* support the class act to create a voluntary, budget-neutral national<br/> insurance program to help adults with disabilities to remain independent<br/> and live in their communities; </p><p>* protect the voting rights of people with disabilities by fully funding<br/> the help america vote act (hava) so that all polling places are fully<br/> accessible, better enforcing the voting accessibility for the elderly<br/> and handicapped act, the ada, and the voting rights act, and opposing<br/> voter id laws; </p><p>* amend the medicare "homebound" rule so that those with disabilities<br/> have the freedom to leave their homes without fear of having their<br/> government benefits taken away; </p><p>* invest in assistive technologies to develop 21st century solutions,<br/> such as home monitoring and communications technologies, that will help<br/> people with disabilities overcome stubborn barriers; </p><p>* research treatments and search for the causes of autism spectrum<br/> disorder (asd) and guarantee that americans with asd can live<br/> independent and fully productive lives; and </p><p>* strengthen specialty care within the veterans administration by<br/> creating additional polytrauma centers as well as centers of excellence<br/> for traumatic brain injury (tbi), ptsd, vision impairment, prosthetics,<br/> spinal cord injury, aging, women's health and other specialized<br/> rehabilitative care.</p></span>
