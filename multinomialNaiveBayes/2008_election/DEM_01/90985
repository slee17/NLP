<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- as america marks the sixth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, we pause to remember each and every victim and to grieve with the families that lost a loved one. we give thanks for the emergency responders who set an example of selfless sacrifice that we will never forget. and we honor the brave men and women of the united states military -- and their families -- for bearing an awesome burden these last six years. the threat that came to our shores that day has only grown. let us resolve to come together again, united as a people as we were in the days after 9/11. let us write a new chapter in american history in which hope triumphs over fear, so that we can defend our homeland, uphold our values, and work for a new birth of freedom and opportunity at home and around the world.</span>
