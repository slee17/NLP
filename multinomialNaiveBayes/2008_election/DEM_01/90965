<span class="displaytext">chicago, il - senator (candidate last) today released the following statement on jobs numbers: <p>"as we head into the 4th of july weekend, today's report that our economy has lost another 62,000 jobs is a stark reminder that far too many americans will spend this holiday out of work and struggling to provide for their families because of the failed policies of the last eight years. </p><p>"our economy has now shed 438,000 jobs over the past six months, while workers' wages fail to keep pace with the skyrocketing cost of gas, groceries and healthcare. the american people are paying the price for the failed economic policies of the past eight years, and we can't afford four more years of more of the same. that is the essential issue of this campaign because senator (candidate last) has fully embraced the bush economic agenda. i believe it has to change. </p><p>"but, as these numbers demonstrate, the american people can't wait another six months. we need action now. </p><p>"that's why i'm calling on congress and the president to enact real, immediate relief with energy rebates for working families this summer, a fund to help families avoid foreclosure, extended benefits for the long-term jobless, and assistance to states that have been hard-hit by the economic downturn. </p><p>"as president, i'll move us in a new direction with policies to restore broad-based, bottom up growth that benefits all americans. i will provide working families with a middle-class tax cut; fight for affordable health care and college tuition; work to help raise workers' wages, and invest in infrastructure, education and a clean energy future to create millions of new jobs. that's the change the american people need."</p></span>
