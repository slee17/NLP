<span class="displaytext">statement on georgian territorial integrity and sovereignty and russian president putin's decree establishing legal ties between russia and the georgian regions of abkhazia and south ossetia <p>georgia is a sovereign country, a member of the united nations, and a close friend of the united states. i welcome the desire by georgia, as well as ukraine, to seek closer ties with nato. </p><p>russian president vladimir putin's decree establishing closer governmental and legal relations with the georgian regions of abkhazia and south ossetia, without the approval of the georgian government, is deeply troubling and contrary to russia's obligations as a permanent member of the un security council. </p><p>putin's declaration falls short of recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia as independent countries, but these pledges of closer ties to these two regions threatens the georgian government and emboldens the secessionist forces in abkhazia and south ossetia. </p><p>georgian president mikhail saakashvili has offered to negotiate substantial autonomy for these regions. negotiations between the georgian government and regional leaders, fully supported by international organizations and responsible governments, are the right way to proceed. by contrast, russia's unilateral decree outside of legal united nations procedures and principles is fundamentally counterproductive. </p><p>since the end of the cold war, (PARTY NAME) and (PARTY NAME) administrations have supported the independence and sovereignty of all states of eastern europe and the former soviet union. we must continue to do so. the advance of democracy and peace in the region is a remarkable achievement that cannot be undone by unilateral acts designed to undermine the territorial integrity of (PARTY NAME) countries like georgia. </p></span>
