(candidate last) touted what he called the most far-reaching ethics and lobbying reform plan of any candidate in this race, and said that his refusal to take money from federal lobbyists or political action committees along with his record of pushing for tough reforms in washington and the illinois state senate shows his commitment to achieving results. <p>"if we are serious about having real change in this country, then we have to start putting america's interests ahead of the special interests that are blocking our efforts to create universal health care, an energy policy that focuses on renewable fuels, and rural investment," (candidate last) said. "we have to break the stranglehold that the lobbyists and special interests have on our democracy. that's why i don't take money from federal lobbyists or pacs, and that's why i have offered the most far-reaching ethics and lobbying reform plan of any candidate in this race. it's a set of proposals that i will begin enacting on my very first day as president - a plan to make the white house the people's house and send the washington lobbyists back to k street."</p><p>(candidate last) said that no one working in an (candidate last) administration will be allowed to lobby the white house after they leave. he also pledged to end no-bid contracts, and to make government more open and transparent.

"when i arrived in washington eight years later, my party made me the point person on ethics, and i was determined to pass the strongest reform possible. this isn't just the rhetoric of a campaign for me, this has been the cause of my life." </p><p><b>background on (candidate last)'s ground-breaking reform efforts that weren't always popular with politicians</b><br/> <b>ethics reforms championed by (candidate last) 'revolutionized' the illinois system:</b> "the disclosure requirement 'revolutionized illinois's system,' said cindi canary, executive director of the illinois campaign for political reform. by giving journalists immediate access to a database of expenditures and contributions, it transformed political reporting. it also, she said, 'put senator (candidate last) on a launching pad and put the mantle of ethics legislator on his crown.'"
