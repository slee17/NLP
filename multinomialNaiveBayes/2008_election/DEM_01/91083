<span class="displaytext">chicago, il - today, senator (candidate last) made the following statement acknowledging october as breast cancer awareness month.<p>"today, i'm proud to add my voice in support of breast cancer awareness month. for me, the fight against cancer is deeply personal. my mother died of ovarian cancer in the prime of her life. and at a time when she should have been focused on getting well, she was lying in a hospital bed arguing with her insurance company because they refused to cover her treatment. </p><p>"for millions of americans, my mother's story is all too familiar. that's why, as president, i will make the fight against cancer an urgent national priority by doubling federal cancer research funding. what's more, i'll enact health care reform that guarantees affordable coverage for every american who wants it, and we'll make sure that insurance companies can no longer discriminate against those who are sick and need care the most. because screening saves lives, i'll require coverage of essential preventive services like mammograms in all federally supported health plans. and because breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among african-american women and latinas, we'll come together to address the root causes of health disparities by promoting prevention, strengthening public health, and implementing patient navigation programs. </p><p>"this year, more than 200,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. millions more will love someone who is. this month, as we rededicate ourselves to finding a cure, we must also dedicate ourselves to making sure that everyone who is diagnosed with cancer gets the care, treatment, and support they need. now is the time to commit ourselves to waging a war against cancer as aggressive as the war cancer wages against us."</p></span>
