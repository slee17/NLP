<span class="displaytext">senator (candidate full) made the following statement today in response to the iraq war report. <p>"changing the definition of success to stay the course with the wrong policy is the wrong course for our troops and our national security. the time to end the surge and to start bringing our troops home is now - not six months from now. the iraqi government is not achieving the political progress that was the stated purpose of the surge, and in key areas has gone backwards. our military cannot sustain its current deployments without crippling our ability to respond to contingencies around the world. it's time for a change of direction that brings our troops home, applies real pressure on the iraqis to act, surges our diplomacy, and addresses iraq's urgent humanitarian crisis. i can only support a policy that begins an immediate removal of our troops from iraq's civil war, and initiates a sustained drawdown of our military presence."</p></span>
