<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- u.s. senator (candidate full) released the following statement on health care. <p>"i commend senator (candidate last) for her health care proposal. it's similar to the one i put forth last spring, though my universal health care plan would go further in reducing the punishing cost of health care than any other proposal that's been offered in this campaign. but the real key to passing any health care reform is the ability to bring people together in an open, transparent process that builds a broad consensus for change. that's how i was able to pass health care reform in illinois that covered an additional 150,000 children and their parents, and that's how we'll prevent the drug and insurance industry from defeating our reform efforts like they did in 1994."</p></span>
