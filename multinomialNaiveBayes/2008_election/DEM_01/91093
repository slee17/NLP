<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- "i join the people of kenya and their friends all over the world in welcoming yesterday's power-sharing agreement. i congratulate president kibaki and raila odinga and the people of kenya for taking the steps necessary to achieve this important agreement. i applaud kofi annan, whose persistence and skill made this breakthrough possible, as well as president kufuor, president kikwete, secretary rice, archbishop tutu, former president mkapa and so many others who worked hard to support the kenyan people in their time of crisis. <p>kenya's power-sharing agreement is a vital step forward, but it must not lead to complacency. the difficult work of constitutional and electoral reform, strengthening the rule of law, land reform, and addressing underlying inequalities in kenyan society remains to be done. to build lasting peace and sustained progress, all members of the new coalition must make an enduring commitment to democracy, cooperation and national unity. reforms must be implemented with a sense of urgency in order to restore peace and the confidence of the kenyan people in their government and hard-won democracy. the united states, and the international community, must remain fully engaged and provide generous support to ensure swift and full implementation of this agreement. </p><p>as we look forward to a more hopeful future for all kenyans, we will not forget those who were lost to the terrible violence of the last several weeks. let the legacy of those who were lost be a kenya that is more peaceful, more prosperous, and more united." </p></span>
