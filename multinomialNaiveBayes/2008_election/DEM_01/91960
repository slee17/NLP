<span class="displaytext">columbus, oh - ohio treasurer richard cordray today endorsed senator (candidate full) for president, citing his unique ability to bring people together to change our politics. <p>"i believe in senator (candidate last)'s inspirational message and his effort to create a politics that will bring people together," treasurer cordray said. "that is the kind of leadership we are working to provide in ohio, and it is badly needed to change the federal government in washington." </p><p>"treasurer cordray's distinguished record of leadership in ohio represents the very best in our tradition of public service," senator (candidate last) said. "an ohioan by birth, he has a fundamental understanding of the challenges facing working families in these difficult times. he knows how critical it is that we make quality health care affordable to every american and that our tax code stops rewarding companies that ship our jobs overseas and starts putting tax breaks back in the pockets of hardworking ohioans. </p><p>"but treasurer cordray also understands that none of this is going to be possible unless we can bring people together and finally put aside our divisive, petty politics and fundamentally change the way that washington works. the treasurer is going to be an extraordinary asset in this movement for change, and i look forward to working alongside him as we campaign in towns and cities across ohio in the weeks to come."</p></span>
