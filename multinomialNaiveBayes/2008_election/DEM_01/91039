<span class="displaytext">chicago, il - "for decades, al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat. i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence, but must fast-track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power, wind power and advanced biofuels, and those are the investments i will make as president. it's a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced, and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer."</span>
