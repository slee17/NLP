<span class="displaytext"><b>harry smith:</b> lincoln said, "all i ever hoped to be, i'd owe to her," in speaking about his mother. your grandmother was very much like a mother to you. how important is this trip? <p><b>(candidate full):</b> it's very important to me. that - my mother was a single mom, so she raised me with the help of my grandparents. and so, my grandmother, my grandfather, and my mom, they're really the people who took care of me, all throughout my childhood. my grandmother's the last one left. she has really been the rock of the family, the foundation of the family. whatever strength, discipline - that - that i have - it comes from her." </p><p><b>harry smith:</b> you've said in the past that you regretted - your own mother's illness - and her death came so quickly. you didn't have time to get back to see her. </p><p><b>(candidate full):</b> yeah, got there too late. ... we knew - she wasn't doing well. but you know, the diagnosis was such that we thought we had a little more time, and we didn't. and so i want to make sure that i don't - i don't make - the same mistake twice. </p><p><b>harry smith:</b> some people say there's risk involved in this, with so little time left. </p><p><b>(candidate full):</b> yeah, well - the - yeah, i think most people understand - that if you're not - caring for your family - then - you're probably not - the kind of person who's gonna be caring for other people. </p><p><b>harry smith:</b> i want to talk about some campaign issues, not the least of which is - your running mate, (candidate full). ... (he) talked about, 'well - (candidate full)'s gonna be tested, within the first six months.' (candidate full) jumped on that and said, 'i don't need to be tested. i'm ready.' are you more ready to be president of the united states than (candidate full) is? </p><p><b>(candidate full):</b> i tell - all i can say is this: we've had, over the last couple of months, i think, an interesting series of tests. and - i think that i have been steadier. i think my advisers and my team and my organization, what we've built, has - has performed - with the kind of calm resolve and deliberation that the white house needs right now. any president is gonna be tested - by the enormity of the challenges that we face. </p><p><b>harry smith:</b> the rancorous tone of this campaign - i was with (candidate full) on monday, and i said, 'our poll data shows that it's actually hurting you.' he says, 'i wouldn't be doing it if he weren't doing it.' </p><p><b>(candidate full) (laughing):</b> well, look. i - i mean - politics is tough. ... but i will say this: i don't think there's any equivalence between what we've been doing and what (candidate full)'s been doing. ... witness some of the comments that have been made just over the last several months, his last several weeks, 'socialistic.' you know, 'pals around with terrorists.' i mean, just - the kinds of stuff that - that i can't imagine saying about an opponent of mine. </p><p><b>harry smith:</b> whoever gets elected president somehow has to put their arm around the whole country and say, 'we're in this together.' </p><p><b>(candidate full):</b> yeah. </p><p><b>harry smith:</b> can you do that? </p><p><b>(candidate full):</b> i can. and i think that's the tone that we've set from the beginning of this campaign. i mean, look. is - is - is sean hannity suddenly gonna get on the airwaves and say, 'you know, i was wrong about this (candidate last) guy. he's - he's my man.' no, that's not gonna happen. i mean, there's gonna be a certain - wing of the (PARTY NAME) party - that is - dug in and resistant to the notion that we need to change direction. </p><p><b>harry smith:</b> and you close your eyes for a moment, and you think about election night. do you win? </p><p><b>(candidate full):</b> well, i - i wouldn't have gotten into this race if i didn't think i was gonna win. ... if it's tied going into election day, i - i like our chances, because i think we've got enormous enthusiasm on the ground.</p></span>
