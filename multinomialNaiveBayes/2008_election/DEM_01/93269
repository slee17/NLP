<span class="displaytext">below is a statement from (candidate last) campaign manager david plouffe. <p>"the (candidate last) campaign has admitted that they do not possess the 'scandalous information' in question and we take them at their word. but what we don't accept is their assertion that this is somehow falling for (PARTY NAME) tricks. this is exactly the kind of smear politics, (PARTY NAME) need to fight back on, regardless of the source or the party. (PARTY NAME) should know that when (candidate full) is their nominee, he will not allow the 'swift boat' politics of fear and diversion to prevail in this campaign."</p></span>
