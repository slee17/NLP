<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- "i congratulate asif ali zardari on his election as president of pakistan. i am glad to hear of his pledge to return this office to its traditional stature, and return to parliament the powers unconstitutionally appropriated to the presidency. i am also glad to hear of the restoration of several deposed judges, an important step towards the restoration of a truly independent judiciary. i wish mr. zardari well, and look forward to working with him to confront the extremists who threaten pakistan and the united states." </span>
