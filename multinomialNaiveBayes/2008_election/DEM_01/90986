<span class="displaytext">chicago, il - today senator (candidate last) issued the following statement on the anniversary of the tragedy at virginia tech. <p>"one year after the tragedy at virginia tech, families are still mourning, and our nation is still healing. as americans gather today in vigils and 'lie-ins' - or pray silently alone - our thoughts are with those whose lives were forever changed by the shootings. but one year later, it's also time to reflect on how violence - whether on campuses like virginia tech and northern illinois university or on the streets of chicago and cities across this nation - can be prevented. clearly, our state and federal governments have to strengthen some laws and do a better job enforcing others. but we all have a responsibility to do what we can in our own lives and communities to end this kind of senseless violence. that is still our task one year later, and it will be our ongoing task in the years to come."</p></span>
