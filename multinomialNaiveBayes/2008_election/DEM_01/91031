<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- senator (candidate full) issued the following statement today in support of passenger service workers at airports throughout california: <p>"today, i stand with the airline service workers on strike at los angeles international airport. the demands they're fighting for aren't unreasonable - access to health care, adequate training, proper equipment, wages that can support a family - they're what america's workers deserve. their efforts send a strong signal that it's not good for workers, passengers, or the industry when business fails to live up to its end of the bargain. </p><p>"by supporting the security personnel who don't have the staffing or training to ensure passenger safety or deal with high turnover rates, the crewmembers in dangerous conditions who can't afford health care, and the service workers who after more than a decade on the job still don't earn a living wage that makes ends meet, we all benefit. </p><p>"for the airline industry, meeting these demands is inextricably tied to passenger safety, quality service, and the health of our economy. our airlines have a responsibility to their workers and passengers to come back to the bargaining table so that union members can go back to work." </p><p>to read senator (candidate last)'s plan to continue fighting for america's workers, click <ahref>here.</ahref></p></span>
