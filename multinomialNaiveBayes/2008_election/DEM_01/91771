<span class="displaytext">des moines, ia -- 268 iowa (PARTY NAME)s today announced their support for senator (candidate full), saying he is the only candidate in either party who can break through the gridlock in washington because he has a proven record of bringing (PARTY NAME)s and (PARTY NAME) together to solve problems. in illinois, (candidate last) bridged the partisan divide to extend health care to 150,000 illinois families, pass a $100 million tax cut for working families and enact historic ethics reform. <p>"with all challenges our country faces, we cannot elect a president who will go to washington and just get bogged down by the same partisan gridlock," brett blix said. "that's why i'm supporting senator (candidate last) even though i'm a (PARTY NAME). he's the only candidate in either party with a record of bringing (PARTY NAME)s and (PARTY NAME) together to solve problems, and he will always tell you where he stands even when you disagree. there are thousands of disaffected (PARTY NAME)s like me who are disappointed by president bush and the (PARTY NAME) presidential candidates who would consider voting for a (PARTY NAME) who can bring about change we can believe in." </p><p>brett blix is 30-year-old iraq war veteran from northwood, iowa. he recently switched his party registration so that he can caucus for senator (candidate last). </p><p>this public support from iowa (PARTY NAME)s is yet another sign of senator (candidate last)'s crossover appeal. previously, (candidate last) received third place in a poll of (PARTY NAME) caucus goers - receiving more support from (PARTY NAME)s than (candidate full), (candidate full) and sam brownback combined. university of iowa professor and (candidate full) supporter david redlawsk said, "i do think that the message (candidate last) is putting out right now is the most likely to reach across party lines." </p><p>"i've always believed that you can only bring about real change when people come together across party lines, and i've seen what happens when folks put politics aside and get down to work," senator (candidate last) said. "if you can't bring people together across the old fault lines, you simply aren't going to be able to make progress on the challenges we face." </p><p>last weekend, former senate majority leader tom daschle from south dakota, former mississippi governor ray mabus and former oklahoma congressman brad carson, all (PARTY NAME) from so-called red states, criss-crossed iowa talking about how (candidate last) appeals to the (PARTY NAME)s and independents in their home states.</p></span>
