"(candidate full) is the only candidate who will be able to break the partisan logjam and inspire americans to come together around real solutions." </p><p>"i've always believed that you can only bring about real change when people come together across party lines, and i've seen what happens when folks put politics aside and get down to work," senator (candidate last) said. "if you can't bring people together across the old fault lines, you simply aren't going to be able to make progress on the challenges we face."</p></span>
