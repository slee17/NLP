<span class="displaytext">chicago, il - senator (candidate full) today released the following statement on women's history month. <p>"women's history month isn't just a chance to celebrate women's history; it's a chance to honor the extraordinary role women have played in shaping american history. from midnight journeys on the underground railroad to marches for women's suffrage and civil rights, from the bomber assembly lines of world war ii to the boardrooms of today, women have always shown us what we can achieve when we refuse to settle for the world as it is and choose to remake the world as it should be. </p><p>"but despite the achievements we honor this month, we know we still have challenges to overcome. we need to build an america where women earn the same pay as men for the same work, and have time off to care for a loved one who's sick; where women have control over the health care decisions that affect their lives, and don't have to choose between their kids and their careers. it's not enough to have a holiday that honors women if we don't also make sure our laws value women. </p><p>"this holiday is particularly meaningful to me because i would not be the person i am without the women in my life. i was raised by a single mother across two continents, and by a grandmother who instilled in me her own midwestern values. and my wife michelle - a woman who's overcome a number of challenges as a lawyer and hospital executive - continues to make me a better man. </p><p>"every night i'm home, michelle and i tuck two little girls into bed. and we want to make sure that they have the same opportunities as every little boy in this country. that's the dream that women have fought for throughout our nation's history, and that's the dream i'll fight to make real as president of the united states."</p></span>
