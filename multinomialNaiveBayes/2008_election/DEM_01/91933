<span class="displaytext"><i>admirals, generals who served under last nine commanders-in-chief cite (candidate last)'s judgment to lead </i><p>remarks as prepared for delivery below  </p><p>chicago, il - citing his judgment and ability to lead, admirals and generals from the united states army, navy and air force that together have served under the last nine commanders-in-chief today announced their endorsement of senator (candidate full) for president. </p><p>in offering their endorsement, the generals and admirals recognized (candidate last)'s judgment to oppose the war in iraq before it began, his respect for the constitution and rule of law, his leadership on behalf of america's servicemen and women and his ability to conduct the diplomacy necessary to restore america's standing in the world. </p><p>"those of us who have served, worn the cloth of our nation, and gone into harm's way know that to be successful we must have the strongest sense of trust in our commander in chief. we must be confident that he or she has listened to the best possible advice, that he or she has garnered the best possible information from all possible sources, that he or she has analyzed and weighed all the possible consequences and outcomes, and that he or she has made the decision to exert military force as a last possible resort," said admiral (ret.) robert "william" williamson (usn). "of this i am certain: senator (candidate last) will do all of those things and much more to ensure the safety and f reedom of our citizens, our allies, and coalition partners. he has all the great qualities and attributes required to carry out the most difficult duties of the presidency. </p><p>"i spent a career involved in coalition warfare, and i am keenly aware of the importance of working with allies," said brigadier general (ret.) james smith (usaf). "senator (candidate last) brings a powerful approach to dealing with national security challenges by truly leveraging multinational relationships. he brings a new face of america to the rest of the world." </p><p>"senator (candidate last) has a profound, even scholarly knowledge of our constitution and he has the deepest respect for the rule of law. as a career naval officer, i trust his judgment, his temperament, and his ability to analyze complex international situations and relationships and to make military decisions that are in the best long term interests of the united states," said admiral (ret.) don guter (usn). "it will take the powerful leadership of senator (candidate last) to forge the consensus we need to right our ship of state, restore our honorable place in the world, and secure the safety of our nation." </p><p>"as a child of the greatest generation i learned that the attraction, glory and resilience of america come from the principle of "we the people." in my four decades in the national security arena i developed an increasing appreciation for the intent and expectations of this principle, particularly in terms of the common defense and domestic tranquility," said brigadier general (ret.) david mcginnis (arng). "in recent years, enticed to believe that these roles belonged to a chosen elite, each of us have paid an increasing price in loss of power, liberties, and national treasure. today, by every measure, our current strategic situation is not good. it is from that perspective i believe only senator (candidate last) offers us the opportunity to reclaim our republic, restore our national dignity and ensure our overall security. i salute his leadership, embrace his candidacy, and commend his courage." </p><p>(candidate last) is the grandson of a soldier who marched in patton's army. throughout his career, he has exercised the judgment and leadership required of a commander-in-chief. in 2002, he opposed the war in iraq from the beginning, cautioning that it could lead to "an occupation of undetermined length, with undetermined costs and undetermined consequences" at a time when conventional washington was lining up for war. as a member of the senate foreign relations committee, he has worked across the aisle to secure the world's most dangerous weapons and as a member of the senate veterans affairs committee, he has compiled a record of standing up for america's troops and veterans, leading a bipartisan effort to improve care for injured troops, passing laws to fight homelessness among veterans, and increase screening for traumatic brain injury. over the course of the last year, (candidate last) has unveiled a comprehensive national security agenda that includes detailed plans to secure america from the threat of terrorism, responsibly end the war in iraq and renew american diplomacy to restore our standing in the world. </p><p><b>the following admirals and generals endorsed senator (candidate full) for president</b>: </p><p><b>brigadier general larry

(candidate full)<br/> endorsement by us admirals and generals<br/> chicago history museum<br/> march 12, 2008 </p><p>it is my privilege to be joined by some of the distinguished generals and admirals supporting my campaign. they have defended the american people and stood up for american values with honor and distinction. between them they have served nine commanders-in-chief, and i look forward to continuing to draw on their counsel throughout my campaign and beyond. </p><p>as as a candidate for the presidency, i know that i am running to be commander-in-chief — to safeguard this nation's security, and to keep our sacred trust with the men and women who serve. there is no responsibility that i take more seriously. </p><p>this is something that i've talked about throughout this campaign. because i believe that any candidate for president must present the american people with a clear vision of how we will lead. there are real differences between the candidates, and important issues to debate — from ending the war in iraq, to combating terrorism, to devising new strategies and new capabilities to confront 21st century threats. </p><p>but recently, we've seen a different kind of approach. instead of a serious, substantive debate, we've heard vague allusions to a "commander-in-chief threshold" that seems to be about nothing more than the number of years you've spent in washington. </p><p>this is exactly what's wrong with the national security debate in washington. </p><p>after years of a divisive politics that uses national security as a wedge to drive us apart, how much longer do we have to wait to bring this country together to confront our common enemies? </p><p>after years of being told that (PARTY NAME) have to talk, act and vote like (candidate full) to pass some commander-in-chief test, how many times do we have to learn that tough talk is not a substitute for sound judgment? </p><p>after years of a war in iraq that should've never been authorized, how many more politicians will appeal to the american peoples' fears instead of their hopes? </p><p>this moment — in this election — is our chance to put an end to a divisive politics that has done nothing to keep america safe, or to serve our men and women in uniform as well as they are serving us. because the real commander-in-chief threshold doesn't have to do with years tallied up in washington, it has to do with the judgment and vision that you will bring to the oval office. </p><p>on the most important national security question since the cold war, i am the only candidate who opposed the war in iraq from the beginning. this judgment was not about speeches, it was about whether or not the united states of america would go to war in iraq. because we did, we took our eye off al qaeda; we have lost thousands of lives and spent hundreds of billions of dollars; our military is overstretched; and our security and standing has been set back. so don't tell me that the decision to go to war was just a speech, because it was far more than that to the men and women who have served — and continue to serve heroically in iraq. </p><p>when i spoke out against the war, i said that i was not opposed to all wars. in fact, one of the central reasons why i opposed going to war in iraq is that we had yet to finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban. that remains true today. that is why i have consistently called for an increased commitment to afghanistan, and why i called last august for at least two additional combat brigades to support our mission there. and that is why i will end the war in iraq when i am president, and focus on finishing the job in afghanistan. </p><p>i will never hesitate to defend this country and our critical interests. that is why i am the only candidate who has made it clear that we cannot tolerate any safe-haven for terrorists who threaten america. but we must also use all elements of national power to combat the threats of the 21st century, and that means deploying the power of american diplomacy before we deploy our troops. that is why we must be willing to talk to the leaders of all nations — friend and foe. </p><p>the threats we face are increasingly unconventional, and they call for new approaches. i have worked on the senate foreign relations committee to combat the challenges of the 21st century — securing loose weapons and nuclear materials from terrorists; working to stop ethnic killing and genocide in africa; and investing in our ability to combat epidemic diseases like avian flu that can be deadly at home and sew instability abroad. </p><p>and one theme that i hear in talking to military officers — whether generals and admirals, or the mid-level officers who will lead tomorrow's military — is that we need new capabilities to respond to this century's new threats. </p><p>we must maintain our overwhelming conventional advantage — and i will. we also need to increase the size of our ground forces by 65,000 soldiers and 27,000 marines to relieve the strain on our troops, and to increase our capacity to put boots on the ground. we need to invest in capabilities like civil affairs, foreign languages, and training foreign militaries, so that we can confront nimble enemies. we need to give our civilian agencies the ability to operate alongside our military in post-conflict zones and on humanitarian missions. and we must inspire a new generation of americans to serve their country, in the military and in a civilian capacity. </p><p>and let me be very clear: when i am commander-in-chief, i will seek out, listen to, and respect the views of military commanders. under this administration, too often we have seen civilian control turned into an expectation that the uniformed military will be punished if they tell the president what he needs to know, rather than what he wants to hear. when i am president, the buck will stop with me, but we will restore trust and open dialogue between the military and civilian leadership. </p><p>finally, it is the sacred obligation of any commander in chief to give the men and women who have served the care and support they have earned. that is what i have tried to do on the senate veterans affairs committee — working to improve care and benefits for wounded warriors and their families, and to enhance screening and treatment for ptsd and traumatic brain injury, the signature wounds of the wars in iraq and afghanistan. </p><p>as president, i will ask myself every day whether i am serving our troops and veterans as well as they have served america. that means only sending them into harm's way when we absolutely must; providing them with a clear mission and the equipment they need to do the job; standing by them when they come home; and helping them live their dreams after they leave the service. </p><p>like the men who have joined me on this stage today, my story is only possible in america. it is the story of my grandfather, who marched in patton's army; and my father, who crossed the globe to be a part of the dream that my grandfather defended. an america that secures its people, and stands as a light of hope for the world. </p><p>that is the america that i will defend as commander-in-chief, drawing on the counsel of military commanders and the courage and conviction of the american people. an america where we meet the challenges of the 21st century with sound judgment, clear plans, and a common purpose.</p></span>
