<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- senator (candidate full) today released the following statement to commemorate the national peace officers memorial day. <p>"on this national peace officers memorial day, we honor the men and women who lost their lives making our streets safer and our families more secure, including the 181 courageous americans who fell in the line of duty last year - and our thoughts and prayers go out to their loved ones. whether it's on our city streets or country roads, patrolling our neighborhoods or putting criminals behind bars, our law enforcement officers go to work every morning not for a big salary or a lot of recognition, but to protect our communities. and so today, as we mourn the loss of our fallen heroes, let's also express our abiding gratitude to all the men and women in law enforcement who serve and sacrifice each day on our behalf."</p></span>
