<span class="displaytext">chicago, il - statement from u.s. senator (candidate full) on this month's jobs report: <p>"today's jobs report is deeply troubling. last month, our economy lost 49,000 jobs and the unemployment rate saw the greatest rise in more than twenty years. this is a reminder that working families continue to bear the brunt of the failed bush economic policies that (candidate full) wants to continue for another four years. in the first five months of 2008, our economy has lost 324,000 jobs, and workers' wages once again failed to keep pace with the skyrocketing cost of health care, and college tuition, and gas. that's why we can't afford (candidate full)'s plan to spend billions of dollars on tax breaks for big corporations and wealthy ceos, and that's why i'm offering change that will provide working families with a middle-class tax cut, affordable health care and college, and an energy plan that will create up to five million good-paying jobs that can't be outsourced. that's the change the american people are looking for, and that's how we'll build an economy of shared prosperity once more."</p></span>
