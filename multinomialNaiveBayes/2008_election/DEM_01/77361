<span class="displaytext">thank you, president roth, for that generous introduction, and congratulations on your first year at the helm of wesleyan. congratulations also to the class of 2008, and thank you for allowing me to be a part of your graduation. <p>i have the distinct honor today of pinch-hitting for one of my personal heroes and a hero to this country, senator edward kennedy. teddy wanted to be here very much, but as you know, he's had a very long week and is taking some much-needed rest. he called me up a few days ago and i said that i'd be happy to be his stand-in, even if there was no way i could fill his shoes. </p><p>i did, however, get the chance to glance at the speech he planned on delivering today, and i'd like to start by passing along a message from him: "to all those praying for my return to good health, i offer my heartfelt thanks. and to any who'd rather have a different result, i say, don't get your hopes up just yet!" </p><p>so we know that ted kennedy's legendary sense of humor is as strong as ever, and i have no doubt that his equally legendary fighting spirit will carry him through this latest challenge. he is our friend, he is our champion, and we hope and pray for his return to good health. </p><p>the topic of his speech today was common for a commencement, but one that nobody could discuss with more authority or inspiration than ted kennedy. and that is the topic of service to one's country – a cause that is synonymous with his family's name and their legacy. </p><p>i was born the year that his brother john called a generation of americans to ask their country what they could do. and i came of age at a time when they did it. they were the peace corps volunteers who won a generation of goodwill toward america at a time when america's ideals were challenged. they were the teenagers and college students, not much older than you, who watched the civil rights movement unfold on their television sets; who saw the dogs and the fire hoses and the footage of marchers beaten within an inch or their lives; who knew it was probably smarter and safer to stay at home, but still decided to take those freedom rides down south – who still decided to march. and because they did, they changed the world. </p><p>i bring this up because today, you are about to enter a world that makes it easy to get caught up in the notion that there are actually two different stories at work in our lives. </p><p>the first is the story of our everyday cares and concerns – the responsibilities we have to our jobs and our families – the bustle and busyness of what happens in our own life. and the second is the story of what happens in the life of our country – of what happens in the wider world. it's the story you see when you catch a glimpse of the day's headlines or turn on the news at night – a story of big challenges like war and recession; hunger and climate change; injustice and inequality. it's a story that can sometimes seem distant and separate from our own – a destiny to be shaped by forces beyond our control. </p><p>and yet, the history of this nation tells us this isn't so. it tells us that we are a people whose destiny has never been written for us, but by us – by generations of men and women, young and old, who have always believed that their story and the american story are not separate, but shared. and for more than two centuries, they have served this country in ways that have forever enriched both. </p><p>i say this to you as someone who couldn't be standing here today if not for the service of others, and wouldn't be standing here today if not for the purpose that service gave my own life. </p><p>you see, i spent much of my childhood adrift. my father left my mother and i when i was two. when my mother remarried, i lived in indonesia for a time, but was mostly raised in hawaii by her and my grandparents from kansas. my teenage years were filled with more than the usual dose of adolescent rebellion, and i'll admit that i didn't always take myself or my studies very seriously. i realize that none of you can probably relate to this, but there were many times when i wasn't sure where i was going, or what i would do. </p><p>but during my first two years of college, perhaps because the values my mother had taught me –hard work, honesty, empathy – had resurfaced after a long hibernation; or perhaps because of the example of wonderful teachers and lasting friends, i began to notice a world beyond myself. i became active in the movement to oppose the apartheid regime of south africa. i began following the debates in this country about poverty and health care. so that by the time i graduated from college, i was possessed with a crazy idea – that i would work at a grassroots level to bring about change. </p><p>i wrote letters to every organization in the country i could think of. and one day, a small group of churches on the south side of chicago offered me a job to come work as a community organizer in neighborhoods that had been devastated by steel plant closings. my mother and grandparents wanted me to go to law school. my friends were applying to jobs on wall street. meanwhile, this organization offered me $12,000 a year plus $2,000 for an old, beat-up car. </p><p>and i said yes. </p><p>now, i didn't know a soul in chicago, and i wasn't sure what this community organizing business was all about. i had always been inspired by stories of the civil rights movement and jfk's call to service, but when i got to the south side, there were no marches, and no soaring speeches. in the shadow of an empty steel plant, there were just a lot of folks who were struggling. and we didn't get very far at first. </p><p>i still remember one of the very first meetings we put together to discuss gang violence with a group of community leaders. we waited and waited for people to show up, and finally, a group of older people walked into the hall. and they sat down. and a little old lady raised her hand and asked, "is this where the bingo game is?" </p><p>it wasn't easy, but eventually, we made progress. day by day, block by block, we brought the community together, and registered new voters, and set up after school programs, and fought for new jobs, and helped people live lives with some measure of dignity. </p><p>but i also began to realize that i wasn't just helping other people. through service, i found a community that embraced me; citizenship that was meaningful; the direction i'd been seeking. through service, i discovered how my own improbable story fit into the larger story of america. </p><p>each of you will have the chance to make your own discovery in the years to come. and i say "chance" because you won't have to take it. there's no community service requirement in the real world; no one forcing you to care. you can take your diploma, walk off this stage, and chase only after the big house and the nice suits and all the other things that our money culture says you should by. you can choose to narrow your concerns and live your life in a way that tries to keep your story separate from america's. </p><p>but i hope you don't. not because you have an obligation to those who are less fortunate, though you do have that obligation. not because you have a debt to all those who helped you get here, though you do have that debt. </p><p>it's because you have an obligation to yourself. because our individual salvation depends on collective salvation. because thinking only about yourself, fulfilling your immediate wants and needs, betrays a poverty of ambition. because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential and discover the role you'll play in writing the next great chapter in america's story </p><p>there are so many ways to serve and so much need at this defining moment in our history. you don't have to be a community organizer or do something crazy like run for president. right here at wesleyan, many of you have already volunteered at local schools, contributed to united way, and even started a program that brings fresh produce to needy families in the area. one hundred and sixty-four graduates of this school have joined the peace corps since 2001, and i'm especially proud that two of you are about to leave for my father's homeland of kenya to bring alternative sources of energy to impoverished areas. </p><p>i ask you to seek these opportunities when you leave here, because the future of this country – your future – depends on it. at a time when our security and moral standing depend on winning hearts and minds in the forgotten corners of this world, we need more of you to serve abroad. as president, i intend to grow the foreign service, double the peace corps over the next few years, and engage the young people of other nations in similar programs, so that we work side by side to take on the common challenges that confront all humanity. </p><p>at a time when our ice caps are melting and our oceans are rising, we need you to help lead a green revolution. we still have time to avoid the catastrophic consequences of climate change if we get serious about investing in renewable sources of energy, and if we get a generation of volunteers to work on renewable energy projects, and teach folks about conservation, and help clean up polluted areas; if we send talented engineers and scientists abroad to help developing countries promote clean energy. </p><p>at a time when a child in boston must compete with children in beijing and bangalore, we need an army of you to become teachers and principals in schools that this nation cannot afford to give up on. i will pay our educators what they deserve, and give them more support, but i will also ask more of them to be mentors to other teachers, and serve in high-need schools and high-need subject areas like math and science. </p><p>at a time when there are children in the city of new orleans who still spend each night in a lonely trailer, we need more of you to take a weekend or a week off from work, and head down south, and help rebuild. if you can't get the time, volunteer at the local homeless shelter or soup kitchen in your own community. find an organization that's fighting poverty, or a candidate who promotes policies you believe in, and find a way to help them. </p><p>at a time of war, we need you to work for peace. at a time of inequality, we need you to work for opportunity. at a time of so much cynicism and so much doubt, we need you to make us believe again. </p><p>now understand this - believing that change is possible is not the same as being naïve. go into service with your eyes wide open, for change will not come easily. on the big issues that our nation faces, difficult choices await. we'll have to face some hard truths, and some sacrifice will be required – not only from you individually, but from the nation as a whole. </p><p>there is no magic bullet to our energy problems, for example; no perfect energy source - so all of us will have to use the energy sources we have more wisely. deep-rooted poverty will not be reversed overnight, and will require both money and reform at a time when our federal and state budgets are strapped and washington is skeptical that reform is possible. transforming our education system will require not only bold government action, but a change in attitudes among parents and students. bringing an end to the slaughter in darfur will involve navigating extremely difficult realities on the ground, even for those with the best of intentions. </p><p>and so, should you take the path of service, should you choose to take up one of these causes as your own, know that you'll experience frustrations and failures. even your successes will be marked by imperfections and unintended consequences. i guarantee you, there will certainly be times when friends or family urge you to pursue more sensible endeavors with more tangible rewards. and there will be times when you are tempted to take their advice. </p><p>but i hope you'll remember, during those times of doubt and frustration, that there is nothing naïve about your impulse to change this world. because all it takes is one act of service – one blow against injustice – to send forth that tiny ripple of hope that robert kennedy spoke of. </p><p>you know, ted kennedy often tells a story about the fifth anniversary celebration of the peace corps. he was there, and he asked one of the young americans why he had chosen to volunteer. and the man replied, "because it was the first time someone asked me to do something for my country." </p><p>i don't know how many of you have been asked that question, but after today, you have no excuses. i am asking you, and if i should have the honor of serving this nation as president, i will be asking again in the coming years. we may disagree on certain issues and positions, but i believe we can be unified in service to a greater good. i intend to make it a cause of my presidency, and i believe with all my heart that this generation is ready, and eager, and up to the challenge. </p><p>we will face our share of cynics and doubters. but we always have. i can still remember a conversation i had with an older man all those years ago just before i left for chicago. he said, "barack, i'll give you a bit of advice. forget this community organizing business and do something that's gonna make you some money. you can't change the world, and people won't appreciate you trying. but you've got a nice voice, so you should think about going into television broadcasting. i'm telling you, you've got a future." </p><p>now, he may have been right about the tv thing, but he was wrong about everything else. for that old man has not seen what i have seen. he has not seen the faces of ordinary people the first time they clear a vacant lot or build a new playground or force an unresponsive leader to provide services to their community. he has not seen the face of a child brighten because of an inspiring teacher or mentor. he has not seen scores of young people educate their parents on issues like darfur, or mobilize the conscience of a nation around the challenge of climate change. he has not seen lines of men and women that wrap around schools and churches, that stretch block after block just so they could make their voices heard, many for the very first time. </p><p>and that old man who didn't believe the world could change – who didn't think one person could make a difference – well he certainly didn't know much about the life of joseph kennedy's youngest son. </p><p>it is rare in this country of ours that a person exists who has touched the lives of nearly every single american without many of us even realizing it. and yet, because of ted kennedy, millions of children can see a doctor when they get sick. mothers and fathers can leave work to spend time with their newborns. working americans are paid higher wages, and compensated for overtime, and can keep their health insurance when they change jobs. they are protected from discrimination in the workplace, and those who are born with disabilities can still get an education, and health care, and fair treatment on the job. our schools are stronger and our colleges are filled with more americans who can afford it. and i have a feeling that ted kennedy is not done just yet. </p><p>but surely, if one man can achieve so much and make such a difference in the lives of so many, then each of us can do our part. surely, if his service and his story can forever shape america's story, then our collective service can shape the destiny of this generation. at the very least, his living example calls each of us to try. that is all i ask of you on this joyous day of new beginnings; that is what senator kennedy asks of you as well, and that is how we will keep so much needed work going, and the cause of justice everlasting, and the dream alive for generations to come. thank you so much to the class of 2008, and congratulations on your graduation.</p></span>
