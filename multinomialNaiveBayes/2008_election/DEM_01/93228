"it's time to stop cutting back the safety net for working people while we protect golden parachutes for the well-off. if you work hard and play by the rules, then you've earned every dollar of your pension. if a company goes bankrupt, then workers need to be our top priority - not an afterthought." </p><p>(candidate full) has a record of fighting for working families that goes back more than two decades. in the u.s. senate, he fought against a bankruptcy bill that did more to protect credit card companies and banks than to help working people. </p><p>as president, (candidate last) will fight for middle class families by requiring the government to match some of the savings of workers making less than $75,000 a year. he'll also create an automatic workplace pension enrollment policy that would require employers to enroll employees in retirement accounts.
