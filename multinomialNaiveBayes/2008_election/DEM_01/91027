<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- below is a statement from senator (candidate last) on today's military commission verdict in the hamdan case:<p>"i commend the military officers who presided over this trial and served on the hearing panel under difficult and unprecedented circumstances. they and all our armed forces continue to serve this country with valor in the fight against terrorism. that the hamdan trial - the first military commission trial with a guilty verdict since 9/11 - took several years of legal challenges to secure a conviction for material support for terrorism underscores the dangerous flaws in the administration's legal framework. it's time to better protect the american people and our values by bringing swift and sure justice to terrorists through our courts and our uniform code of military justice. and while it is important to convict anyone who provides material support for terrorism, it is long past time to capture or kill osama bin laden and the terrorists who murdered nearly 3000 americans."</p></span>
