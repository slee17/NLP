<span class="displaytext">chicago, il-- senator (candidate full) today released the following statement in response to president's veto of iraq funding bill. <p>"with one stroke of his pen, president bush has stubbornly ignored the will of the american people, the majority of congress and, most disturbingly, the realities on the ground in iraq. now we call upon our (PARTY NAME) colleagues in congress to help override this veto and acknowledge what the president will not - that there is no military solution to a political conflict that lies at the heart of this civil war. only the iraqi leadership can make peace, and the best way to pressure them to do so is still a phased withdrawal of american forces with the goal of removing all combat troops from iraq by march 30th, 2008. it is time to end this war so we can bring our troops home and redeploy our forces to help fight the broader struggle against terrorism and other threats of this new century."</p></span>
