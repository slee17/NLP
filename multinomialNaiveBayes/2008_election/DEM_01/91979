<span class="displaytext"><b>u.s. senator daniel akaka endorses (candidate full)</b> <p><i>the senator from hawaii cites (candidate last)'s ability to unite americans around common interests</i> </p><p>chicago, il - today, u.s. senator daniel akaka from hawaii endorsed (candidate full) for president. akaka is the 280th superdelegate to endorse (candidate last), who is now 151 delegates away from securing the (PARTY NAME) nomination. </p><p>senator akaka's statement is below: </p><p>"for more than a year, people have asked me who i plan to endorse for president of the united states. i've waited this long for several reasons. the (PARTY NAME) campaign began with more than ten declared candidates. as a veteran of more than 30 years on capitol hill, i knew each and everyone of them and had worked closely with all. i had no doubt that each of them had the knowledge and ability to lead our country out of the financial and diplomatic chaos that we've experienced for the past eight years. </p><p>having waged a number of campaigns myself, i can tell you they are not easy. campaigns are tests, and there's no tougher one than running for president. like many americans, i've followed the campaign for president closely and with growing interest, eager to see which candidate would articulate a vision for our country, encourage hope and renew faith in our government, and stand to the rigors of a nationwide contest. </p><p>after giving it a lot of thought, i've decided that for me, that candidate is (candidate full). </p><p>rather than echo his supporters or review his platform on health care, the environment, or the war in iraq, i want to add a different voice to those who believe senator (candidate last) would make a fine president. he is the antidote we need to cure washington of the uninspired, partisan politics that has plagued our country far too long. </p><p>what makes him uniquely qualified? a march 2008 feature in vanity fair magazine offers a clue: "he was born and came of age in hawaii, the 50th state and in many ways among the freest 'thinking, where mixed' race ancestry is …a given... if (candidate last) comes across as a bit of a softy—if you don't see the toughness or the ambition at first—it may be in part because he spent his formative years in a place where 'live aloha' had not yet become a slogan aimed at recapturing a more gracious time, but was simply a way of life." </p><p>i have great hope, that in his own way, (candidate full) will achieve what i have been working to accomplish my entire congressional career, more tolerance and understanding, an appreciation for common goals and interests, rather than an emphasis on our differences. </p><p>while i am pledging my support to senator (candidate last), i want to make it very clear that i hold both senator (candidate full) and president bill (candidate last) in the highest regard as colleagues and friends. senator (candidate last) has campaigned hard and well and i wish her all the best as we move forward. in an example of her leadership and commitment, senator (candidate last) has promised that come november, the (PARTY NAME) party will be united behind our presidential nominee and i send her my fondest aloha for her courage and selflessness." </p><p><b>hawaii superdelegate dolly strazar endorses (candidate full)</b> </p><p>chicago, il - today, hawaii superdelegate dolly strazar endorsed (candidate full) for president. strazar is the 279th superdelegate to endorse (candidate last). (candidate last) is 152 delegates away from securing the (PARTY NAME) nomination.</p><p>"as a (PARTY NAME) national committeewoman, i have felt it my duty to let this unique presidential campaign process play out, one that has reached across the country and engaged millions of americans in expressing their preference for a (PARTY NAME) nominee before expressing my preference as a superdelegate. i am now convinced that it is time to pull together behind a single candidate who has the backing of a growing number of americans . i therefore announce my wholehearted endorsement of senator (candidate full). </p><p>i have had and still do have the utmost respect for senator (candidate full) and the positive and uplifting force that both of the (candidate last)s have been in hawaii. it excites me, however, to enter active campaigning for a son of hawaii who learned the lessons of "getting along" that so dominate the values of the people of the fiftieth state. i am convinced that these values of inclusiveness and respect for differences that we take for granted in hawaii are part of what has made our america a nation based on freedom, equality, justice and the pursuit of happiness. i further believe that these values will serve to unify our country and lead us to victory in november. </p><p>the will of (PARTY NAME) in hawaii was expressed loudly and clearly in february and i am proud to see that that same vision has been reflected throughout the country in (PARTY NAME) support for senator (candidate last)." </p><p>dr. marie dolly strazar is a member of the hawaii (PARTY NAME) party. </p><p>############## </p><p><b>idaho superdelegate keith roark endorses (candidate full)</b> </p><p><i>idaho (PARTY NAME) party chairman cites (candidate last)'s ability to help rebuild the party in the west</i> </p><p>chicago, il - today, idaho superdelegate keith roark endorsed (candidate full) for president. roark is the 281st superdelegate to endorse (candidate last), who is 150 delegates away from securing the (PARTY NAME) nomination. </p><p>"after several months of careful consideration, i am announcing today that i will cast my vote this august at the (PARTY NAME) national convention for the next president of the united states, senator barrack (candidate last). i have not come quickly or easily to this decision. (PARTY NAME) are blessed to have two outstanding candidates vying for our party's nomination at this defining moment in american history. </p><p>i have no doubt that senator (candidate last) will run the stronger race. the unprecedented enthusiasm senator (candidate last) has generated here in idaho is unlike anything i have seen in the past 31 years of active political participation in this state. he has captured the imagination and mint fresh optimism of young voters from couer d'alene to caldwell, from murphy to montpelier. i firmly believe that the critical process of rebuilding the idaho (PARTY NAME) party will receive a once in a lifetime boost from senator (candidate last)'s candidacy." </p><p>keith roark is chairman of the idaho (PARTY NAME) party.</p></span>
