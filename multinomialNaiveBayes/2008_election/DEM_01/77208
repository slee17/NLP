<span class="displaytext"><b>blitzer:</b> (candidate full) hasn't clinched the (PARTY NAME) presidential nomination yet, but look at this, the cover of "time" magazine declaring him the winner after the latest round of primaries. how is he marking this important moment in this campaign? <p>well, senator (candidate full) is right here in "the situation room," the very first interview he's given since tuesday's contests in north carolina and indiana. </p><p>senator, welcome. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> good to see you, wolf. </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> here is the cover, "and the winner is..." that's a picture of you. what do you think? </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> well, you know, i think -- i don't want to be jinxed. we've still got some work to do. </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> it's almost like you got the cover of "sports illustrated." is that what you're -- you're nervous about that? </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> exactly. exactly right.</p><p>we've got six more contests left. and then we've got a lot of work to do to bring the party together, but, obviously, we felt very good about our win in north carolina on tuesday. i think we ran a terrific campaign in indiana. and it was a virtual tie. and, if you look at where the race is at this point, i think we have seen voters across the country say they are ready for change. they are feeling real anxiety about the economy. </p><p>and they have come to recognize that, unless we change how washington is done. it's going to be very hard to deliver on a smarter energy policy. it's going to be hard to -- to provide health care for people who need it or make college more affordable. and i think our campaign has benefited from it. and, so, i'm looking forward to bringing this party together and going after (candidate full) in the fall, and -- and, hopefully, getting this country on the right track. </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> it's been intense in the primaries. but you realize it's going to be much more intense in the next chapter, in the next phase, given the differences between you and (candidate full). are you ready for this next phase? </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> i'm actually looking forward to it, if we're successful. i don't want to get ahead of myself here. senator (candidate last) is a very formidable candidate. she is very heavily favored to win west virginia. she will win that by a big margin. </p><p>she's favored in kentucky. we'll probably split the remaining contests. and, so, she's -- she's going to be actively campaigning. </p><p>if i'm fortunate enough to be the nominee, then i am looking forward to the general election precisely because there is such a big, stark contrast...</p><p><i>(crosstalk)</i> </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> there are major differences between you and (candidate full)...</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> exactly. </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> ... on a whole host of domestic issues...</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> exactly. </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> .. and foreign policy issues. and i want to go through those right now. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> sure. </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> already, some of his surrogates, some of his supporters, are suggesting you're not ready to be commander in chief, president of the united states. </p><p>(candidate full), the former governor of massachusetts, said this. listen to this. </p><p><i>(begin video clip)</i></p><p><i>(candidate full) (r), former massachusetts governor:</i> he has not accomplished anything during his life, in terms of legislation, or leading an enterprise, or making a business work or a city work or a state work. he really has very little experience. and the presidency of the united states is not an internship. </p><p><i>(end video clip)</i></p><p><b>blitzer:</b> wow. that's a strong statement. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> yes. </p><p>well, the contest didn't work out so well for (candidate full). i think he was making those same arguments against (candidate full), suggesting that (candidate full), as a senator, hadn't done what (candidate full) had done. and, yet, here we are, and there (candidate full) is. </p><p>look, when it comes to national security, i think that what people are looking for is good judgment. they're looking for somebody who is going to be able to assess the very real risks that are out there and deploy our forces, not just military, but diplomatic, political, economic, cultural, in a way that makes the american people safe.</p><p>and whether it's my judgment on iraq and recognizing that that was going to be a strategic blunder, to my insistence that we need to talk not just to countries we like, but countries we don't, to my assessment in terms of how we had over-invested in the musharraf government in pakistan, and that was going to be setting us up for failure later on, i think i have consistently displayed the kind of judgment that the american people are looking for in the next president. </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> i want -- i want to get to all of those national security, foreign policy issues in a moment. but let's talk about some domestic issues. </p><p>you know they're going to paint you, the (candidate last) camp, (PARTY NAME)s, as a classic tax-and-spend liberal (PARTY NAME), that you're going to raise the taxes for the american people and just spend money like there is no tomorrow when it comes to federal government programs. </p><p>are you ready to handle that kind of assault? </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> absolutely. </p><p>but -- because think about what i am going to be running against: the failed policies of the bush administration, which (candidate full) wants to continue. i don't think there is anybody in this country who thinks that, right now, we have got a government that's managed our domestic policies well. </p><p>and, so, we can talk about the slogans of tax and spend or fiscal conservatism, but the fact of the matter is, this -- we have had an administration that's been profligate, that has raised our national debt to a record level. we have seen a lack of shared prosperity. so, you've got ceos making more in a day than ordinary workers are making in a year, and it's the ceo that's getting the tax break, instead of the workers. </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> he's going to say you're going to raise their taxes. what are you going to say? </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> i will raise ceo taxes. there is no doubt about it. if you are... </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> what about the average american... </p><p><i>(crosstalk)</i> </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> if you are a ceo in this country, you will probably pay more taxes. they won't be prohibitively high. they're -- you're going to be paying roughly what you paid in the '90s, when ceos were doing just fine. </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> so, you want to just eliminate the bush tax cuts? </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> i want to eliminate the bush tax cuts.</p><p>and what i have said is, i will institute a middle-class tax cut. so, if you're making $75,000, if you're making $50,000 a year, you will see an extra $1,000 a year offsetting on your payroll tax.</p><p><b>blitzer:</b> define middle class.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> well, look, i think that the definitions are always a little bit rough, but let's -- let's just take it this way. </p><p>if you're making $100,000 a year or less, then you're pretty solidly middle class, and you deserve relief right now, as opposed to paying higher taxes. on the other hand, if you're making more than $100,000, and certainly if you're making more than $200,000 to $250,000, then you're doing pretty well. </p><p>and it's the people who are making over $200,000, $250,000, who have benefited the most and have actually seen -- have actually seen more and more of economic growth in this country go in your direction. </p><p>and all -- all we're looking for here is a sense of balance, because it's my belief that this country has always grown when it grows from the bottom up, when the average worker who is putting in his time and trying to live out the american dream, when a nurse or a teacher, she's able to support her family, then they spend money, businesses do well, and we generate tax revenues that can pay for the common investments that we need.</p><p>and that's what's been lacking, a sense of shared sacrifice, as well as shared benefits from the economy. </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> because they're arguing already that you want to increase capital gains taxes, for example, on investments, and stocks, and things like that. </p><p><i>(crosstalk)</i> </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> a lot of middle-class people have those kinds of accounts. if they're...</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> if they have, -- wolf, if they have a 401(k), then they are going to see those taxes deferred, and they're going to pay ordinary income when they finally cash out. so, that's a phony argument. and this is something that you have seen the (PARTY NAME)s consistently do, is they try to make this broad- based argument about, he's going to raise your taxes as a cover for them eliminating taxes for people like myself and you, who can afford to pay a little bit more in order to assure that we have got roads and bridges that are rebuilt, in order to assure that social security is solvent, in order to make sure that kids who are struggling for their american dream can actually go to college, in order to make sure that people aren't going bankrupt just because somebody in their family gets sick. </p><p>you know, what -- as i travel around the country, what i'm actually convinced of is that people recognize that if only 1 percent of the population is doing well, when we have got wages and incomes for the average worker actually going down during a period of economic expansion, much less economic recession, that something's being mismanaged. and they want a difference -- a different approach. and that's what we're going to be offering them.</p><p>and (candidate full) is essentially offering four more years of the same policies that got us into this rut that we're in right now. </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> you used to teach constitutional law. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> yes. </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> you know a lot about the supreme court. and the next president of the united states will have an opportunity to nominate justices for the supreme court. </p><p>he gave a speech, (candidate last), this week saying he wants justices like samuel alito and john roberts. and he defined the kind of criteria he wants. </p><p>so, what would be your criteria? </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> well, i think that my first criteria is to make sure that these are people who are capable and competent, and that they are interpreting the law. and, 95 percent of the time, the law is so clear, that it's just a matter of applying the law. i'm not somebody who believes in a bunch of judicial lawmaking. i think...</p><p><b>blitzer:</b> are there members, justices right now upon who you would model, you would look at? who do you like? </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> well, you know, i think actually justice breyer, justice ginsburg are very sensible judges. </p><p>i think that justice souter, who was a (PARTY NAME) appointee, is a sensible judge. what you're looking for is somebody who is going to apply the law where it's clear. now, there's going to be those 5 percent of cases or 1 percent of cases where the law isn't clear. and the judge then has to bring in his or her own perspectives, his ethics, his or her moral bearings.</p><p>and, in those circumstances, what i do want is a judge who's sympathetic enough to those who are on the outside, those who are vulnerable, those who are powerless, those who can't have access to political power, and, as a consequence, can't protect themselves from being -- from being dealt with sometimes unfairly, that the courts become a refuge for judges. </p><p>that's been its historic role. that was its role in brown vs. board of education. i think a judge who is unsympathetic to the fact that, in some cases, we have got to make sure that civil rights are protected, that we have got to make sure that civil liberties are protected, because, oftentimes, there's pressures that are placed on politicians to want to set civil liberties aside, especially at a time when we have had terrorist attacks, making sure that we maintain our separation of powers, so that we don't have a president who is taking over more and more power. </p><p>i think those are all criteria by which i would judge whether or not this is a good appointee. </p><p><i>(end videotape)</i> </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> we're going to have much more of my extensive one-on- one interview senator (candidate full). at one point, he actually gets angry about something (candidate full) said about him. </p><p><i>(begin video clip)</i> </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> this is offensive.</p><p>and i think it's disappointing, because (candidate full) always says, well, i'm not going to run that kind of politics. and then to engage in that kind of smear...</p><p><i>(end video clip)</i> </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> so, what exactly did (candidate last) do or say to spark that kind of reaction? senator (candidate last) will explain. </p><p>and he also talks to me about israel, as israel celebrates 60 years of independence. i'll ask senator (candidate last) what israel means to him. </p><p>stay with us. you're in "the situation room." </p><p><i>(commercial break)</i> </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> now back to senator (candidate full) right here in "the situation room" in his first interview since tuesday's pivotal round of primaries. </p><p><i>(begin videotape)</i> </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> let's go through a couple foreign policy issues. (candidate last) says, if you had your way, the u.s. would surrender in iraq; he wants victory. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> if i had my way, we would not have gone into iraq in the first place. </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> but what about now? </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> i think it was a huge strategic blunder.</p><p>and i think the american people are smart enough to understand that a phased withdrawal, where we're as careful getting out as we were careless getting in, that puts pressure on the iraqis to stand up and take seriously their obligations to arrive at a political accommodation at the same time as we are doubling down on diplomacy in the surrounding region, and not just saudi arabia, turkey, and jordan, but also in syria and iraq, then we are also investing in humanitarian aid for the people who have been displaced in iraq, that that's not surrendering. </p><p>that's a sensible policy that will allow us then to deal with our biggest strategic problem, which is al qaeda in afghanistan and the border regions of pakistan reconstituting themselves. and that's something that we have been distracted from and something that i intend to focus on when i'm president of the united states. </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> this is going to be a huge difference, the war in iraq, the fallout, between you and (candidate last). </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> right. </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> he also is going after you now, today, the 60th anniversary of israel's independence. he says you're not necessarily endorsing policies that would be good for israel. </p><p>he says this, for example: "i think it's very clear who hamas wants to be the next president of the united states. i think that people should understand that i will be hamas' worst nightmare. senator (candidate last) is favored by hamas. i think people can make judgments accordingly."</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> yes, this -- this is offensive.</p><p>and i think it's disappointing, because (candidate full) always says, well, i'm not going to run that kind of politics. and then to engage in that kind of smear, i think, is unfortunate, particularly since my policy towards hamas has been no different than his. </p><p>i have said that they are a terrorist organization, that we should not negotiate with them unless they recognize israel, renounce violence and unless they're willing to abide by previous accords between the palestinians and the israelis. and, so, for him to toss out comments like that, i think, is an example of him losing his bearings as he pursues this nomination. </p><p>we don't need name-calling in this debate. what we're going to need is to have a serious conversation about, how do we keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of the iranian regime, how do we broker a peace deal between the israelis and palestinians that allows both sides to benefit, israel assuring its security and its status as a jewish state, the palestinians able to have a contiguous, functioning state, where their people can prosper?</p><p>and, if we end up continuing to be locked up in these ideological arguments, playing politics of the sort that we have seen (candidate full) doing recently, then i think, frankly, we're going to miss an opportunity to really move this country in a better direction and to reset our foreign policy in a way that i think the world is anxious for. </p><p>the world wants to see the united states lead. they have been disappointed and disillusioned over the last seven, eight years. but i think there is still a sense everywhere i go that, you know, if the united states regains its -- its sense of who it is and our values and our ideals, that we will continue to set the tone for creating a more peaceful and more prosperous world. </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> i want to move on, but, on this 60th anniversary of israel, what -- what does israel mean to you? </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> israel is not only our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but there is a special connection between america and israel, one that, when i traveled to israel, was evident. </p><p>not only do we share so much in terms of common culture. not only is it the site of so much of our -- of my religious faith and the site of so much of our understanding of the world around us, but what i love about israel is, is that it is a robust democracy, and that they are committed to principles like rule of law and civil rights and civil liberties. and so it is critical that we send a message around the world we will stand with israel, we want them around not just for 60 years, but for 600 years. and when i am president of the united states they will have an unwavering ally in me.</p><p><i>(end videotape)</i></p><p><b>blitzer:</b> much more of the interview coming up. you're also going to get a chance to ask senator (candidate last) some questions. one of you wanted to know this regarding (candidate full)...</p><p><i>(begin video clip)</i> </p><p><i>unidentified male:</i> you have some strengths, she has some strengths. so bring the strengths together and become a formidable so-called "dream ticket."</p><p><i>(end video clip)</i></p><p><b>blitzer:</b> you're going to hear senator (candidate last)'s response, one of several answers he has for the questions that you asked, our ireporters. </p><p>plus, senator (candidate last) does something we rarely see. he speaks very emotionally about his mother ahead of mother's day. you're going to want to hear that and his message to all mothers. </p><p>we'll be right back. </p><p><i>(commercial break)</i></p><p><b>blitzer:</b> (candidate full) emerging from the latest round of primaries, looking even more likely to be the (PARTY NAME) presidential nominee. </p><p>let's get back to my interview now with the senator, his first since those critical contests in north carolina and indiana. </p><p><i>(begin videotape)</i> </p><p><b>blitzer:</b> we asked our viewers to send us in some questions, and we got thousands of responses, as you can only imagine. i've got a couple. i just want you to watch one of those and get your reaction. a lot of people asked this basic question.</p><p><i>(begin video clip)</i></p><p><i>unidentified male:</i> it appears that you do not have enough support among blue collar workers as senator (candidate last) did. would you consider just on that basis alone considering her on a joint ticket as vice president?</p><p><i>(end video clip)</i></p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> well, you know, as i said before, "time" magazine notwithstanding, we haven't wrapped this thing up yet. at the point where i'm the nominee, i'll start going through the process of figuring out what -- you know, what my running mate -- who my running mate might be. </p><p>senator (candidate last) has shown herself to be an extraordinary candidate. she is tireless, she is smart, she is capable. and so obviously she'd on anybody's short list to be a potential vice presidential candidate.</p><p>but it would be presumptuous of me at this point, when she is still actively running, when she is highly favored to win the next -- two of the next three contests, for me to somehow suggest that she should be running mate. at this point i think we have to just resolve this process and then we can figure it out.</p><p><b>blitzer:</b> there will be plenty of time down the road for that.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> there will be, yes.</p><p><b>blitzer:</b> all right. here is a question. listen to this one.</p><p><i>(begin video clip)</i></p><p><i>unidentified male:</i> i strongly believe that us human beings are defined by what we've done in our lifetimes. what is the one thing that a president (candidate full), what will he be remembered for achieving during his presidency or during his lifetime?</p><p><i>(end video clip)</i> </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> well, we've got a lot of jobs before us, but the most important thing i think i could achieve, you know, if i am looking back eight years from now and i am fortunate enough to be the president, is that we were able to navigate our way through this situation in iraq and the threat of al qaeda in afghanistan in a way that makes us more secure, stronger, but also enhances our influence around the world, which i think has been diminishing.</p><p>i think the way we have run this war in iraq has lessened our ability to move our allies. it has led us to ignore the critical needs for us to focus on a sound energy policy in this country. it has left us unable to lead on critical global issues like global warming. and it has led us to neglect what ultimately is the most important thing to keeping america safe, and that is having an economy that is the envy of the world and that gives us the resources and the power to project ourselves around the world.</p><p>if china ends up becoming the economic powerhouse of this century, then their military will ultimately match up with that economic power. so part of resetting our foreign policy has to include understanding that there are americans out there who are struggling.</p><p>they want to succeed, they want to get a college education. they want to be scientists. they want to be, you know, on the cutting edge of clean energy. they want to be on the cutting edge of biotech. but we're going to have to make some investments and ensure that the dynamism and the innovation of the american people is released.</p><p>it's very hard for us to do that when we're spending close to $200 billion a year in other countries, rebuilding those countries instead of focusing on making ourselves strong.</p><p><b>blitzer:</b> we're out of time, but a quick question on this mother's day weekend. your mother raised you. she was on food stamps at one point. a single mother.</p><p>if she were alive today and she saw where you have reached, the point that you have reached right now, what would she say to you?</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> she'd say, don't let it get to your head, just keep on working hard. but i think she'd be pretty proud. everything that i am i owe to her. she was the kindest, most generous person i ever met. and her values and her integrity still guide me. </p><p>she is somebody who when i am confronted with difficult choices, i have to ask myself, you know, what would she -- what would she expect of me? and i think that's usually a good guidepost.</p><p>now, i've got to say that the mother that counts most in my life at the moment is michelle, who through a very difficult process continues to raise two of the best daughters that anybody would ever want. and she's out on the campaign trail at the same time and keeping me straight. so happy mother's day to her as well.</p><p><b>blitzer:</b> and happy mother's day to all the mothers out there. </p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> absolutely.</p><p><b>blitzer:</b> ok. senator, thanks very much for coming in.</p><p><b>(candidate last):</b> thank you, wolf. i enjoyed it.</p><p><i>(end videotape)</i></p><p><b>blitzer:</b> (candidate full) in his first interview since the indiana and north carolina primaries.</p></span>
