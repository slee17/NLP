<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- senator (candidate full) today released the following statement in response to the passage of the senate farm bill. <p>"i applaud the senate's passage today of the farm bill, which will provide america's hard-working farmers and ranchers with more support and more predictability." </p><p>"the bill places greater resources into renewable energy and conservation. and, during this time of rising food prices, the farm bill provides an additional $10 billion for critical nutrition programs. i am also pleased that the bill includes my proposal to help thousands of african-american farmers get their discrimination claims reviewed under the pigford settlement." </p><p>"this bill is far from perfect. i believe in tighter payment limits and a ban on packer ownership of livestock. as president, i will continue to fight for the interests of america's family farmers and ranchers and ensure that assistance is geared towards those producers who truly need them, instead of large agribusinesses. but with so much at stake, we cannot make the perfect the enemy of the good." </p><p>"by opposing the bill, president bush and (candidate full) are saying no to america's farmers and ranchers, no to energy independence, no to the environment, and no to millions of hungry people."</p></span>
