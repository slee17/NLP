<span class="displaytext">chicago, il - former lgbt supporters of senator (candidate full) and other candidates are publicly announcing their support of senator (candidate full). almost half of senator (candidate last)' original lgbt steering committee is throwing their support behind (candidate last). most of the other former members remain formally uncommitted. <p>eric stern and david mixner are two of the twenty-eight new supporters who are working to elect senator (candidate last). stern served as a political advisor to (candidate last) and was the head of his lgbt steering committee. mixner was a key advisor to the (candidate last) campaign in 1992. mixner also organized some of the first lgbt fund-raisers for a u.s. presidential candidate. </p><p>"moving from one candidate to another is never an easy process," said mixner, "but the times demand that we all participate fully and completely to bring about change. originally, my support went to senator (candidate last) because of the war in iraq. for the very same reason, i am supporting senator (candidate last). this is not even a close call for me." </p><p>"it became clear to me personally that our committee had a vision for the role of the lgbt community that was similar to the role that lgbt supporters were already playing in the (candidate last) campaign," said stern. "it, like the (candidate last) campaign, is a pure grassroots, activist-oriented operation…and it's clear that we will play a similar role in the (candidate last) campaign."</p><p>the new supporters will help grassroots efforts leading up to the february 5th primaries and the rest of the primary season by reaching out to voters by phone banking and canvassing. </p><p>"we believe that (candidate last) can pick up more delegates if the 12%-15% of (candidate last) supporters nationwide -- and even more in some states -- will turn out for (candidate last)," stern said. "we believe we can make a difference." </p><p>other key members who have put their support behind (candidate last) are:<br/> arizona -- linda elliott, member of the human rights campaign board of directors and a major fund-raiser for defeating the state's constitutional marriage amendment; </p><p>california—jeff anderson and jeff soukup, former california co-chairs of (candidate last) for president; gloria nieto, former vice chair of dnc lgbt caucus; evan low, out council member for the city of campbell; pam cooke, national stonewall (PARTY NAME) board member; past president, stonewall (PARTY NAME) club of los angeles </p><p>colorado—andy szekeres, former co-chair of colorado stonewall (PARTY NAME); </p><p>georgia -- kyle bailey, chair of the atlanta stonewall (PARTY NAME); lgbt caucus vice chair of the young (PARTY NAME) of america; former board member of the national stonewall (PARTY NAME); </p><p>tennessee - jim maynard, president of the memphis stonewall (PARTY NAME)<br/> _______________ </p><p>below is the full list of supporters who are now publicly supporting (candidate last): </p><p>* eric stern, former political adviser to the (candidate full) for president campaign, former national stonewall (PARTY NAME) executive director, former director of lgbt outreach for the (PARTY NAME) national committee (california)<br/> * david mixner, writer, (PARTY NAME) party activist (new york) <br/> * gloria nieto, former vice chair of dnc lgbt caucus <br/> * linda elliott, member of the board of directors for the human rights campaign (arizona) <br/> * evan low, council member for the city of campbell, calif. <br/> * david garrity, vice chair of the maine (PARTY NAME) party; former dnc member <br/> * andy szekeres, former colorado stonewall (PARTY NAME) cochair, former wisconsin lgbt field director, kerry-(candidate last) (colorado) <br/> * kyle bailey, former board member, national stonewall (PARTY NAME), lgbt caucus vice chair of young (PARTY NAME) of america, chair of atlanta stonewall (PARTY NAME) (georgia) <br/> * pam cooke, national stonewall (PARTY NAME) board member; past president, stonewall (PARTY NAME) club of los angeles (california) <br/> * bill hedrick, president of central ohio stonewall (PARTY NAME)<br/> * david mariner, former out for howard dean cochair (maryland) <br/> * jason lansdale, past president of central ohio stonewall (PARTY NAME) <br/> * daniel hinkley, nevada stonewall (PARTY NAME) caucus president <br/> * misty york, communications director for the kentucky fairness alliance <br/> * christopher prevatt, chair of eleanor roosevelt (PARTY NAME) club (orange county, calif.) <br/> * jim maynard, president of memphis stonewall (PARTY NAME) (tennessee) <br/> * daniel graney, past president of stonewall (PARTY NAME) of san antonio (texas) <br/> * arthur nunn, former missouri for (candidate last) volunteer organizer and founder of lgbt for (candidate last) myspace group <br/> * brad reichard, public pelations executive (massachusetts) <br/> * michael shannon, national security expert (d.c.) <br/> * les krambeal, board member for the national stonewall (PARTY NAME), cochair, southern arizona stonewall (PARTY NAME) <br/> * robert d. horvath jr., member of the board of directors for the mautner project (d.c.) <br/> * patrick j. lyden, lgbt community activist (d.c.) <br/> * jeff prang,west hollywood city council <br/> * tom ammiano, san fran board of supervisors <br/> * rich tafel, formerly of national log cabin (PARTY NAME)s <br/> * jeff soukup, board member of gay and lesbian alliance against defamation, former president and coo, planetout inc., and former co-chair national gay and lesbian victory fund <br/> * jeff anderson, former co-chair of john kerry for president national lgbt finance committee <br/> * bill rosendahl, la city council <br/> * susan belinda christian, co-chair of alice b. toklas lgbt (PARTY NAME) club <br/> * patrick shepherd, former president of cleveland stonewall (PARTY NAME); board member for the national stonewall (PARTY NAME) <br/> * joseph lamonica, former board member of the san antonio stonewall (PARTY NAME).<br/> * brian polejes,vice president for organizing pride at work* </p><p>*organizations listed for identification purposes only.</p></span>
