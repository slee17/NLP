<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- (candidate full) made the following statement today in response to president bush's speech to the american legion. <p>"there is an eerie echo to the president's words today. five years ago, he made a misleading case to the american people that the trail to al qaeda and osama bin laden somehow led through iraq, and too many in washington followed without asking the hard questions that should have been raised. now we are dealing with the consequences of that failure of candor and judgment, and the president is using the politics of fear to continue a wrong-headed policy. it's time to turn the page on the failed bush-cheney strategy and conventional washington thinking, remove our combat troops from iraq, mount a long overdue surge of diplomacy, and focus our attention on a resurgent al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan."</p></span>
