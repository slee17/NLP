<span class="displaytext">chicago, il - senator (candidate last) released the following statement on president bush' strategy of staying the course in iraq. <p>"president bush gave no answer to the most important question about the way forward in iraq: how will we end this war that is not making us safer? after five years, over four thousand lives, and over half a trillion dollars, we have a blank check strategy in iraq that is overstretching our military, distracting us from the other challenges we face, burdening our economy, and failing to pressure the iraqi government to take responsibility for their future. we cannot press iraq's leaders to resolve their differences and spend their money if our plan is to stay in iraq indefinitely. we cannot relieve the enormous strain on our military and our military families unless we restore adequate time at home for our troops â€” 12 month deployments represent a step forward, but we need to give our troops adequate dwell time at home. we cannot finish the fight in afghanistan and focus on osama bin laden and al qaeda's core leadership unless we end this war that should've never been authorized. the decision to go to war in iraq was an enormous strategic blunder, and president bush is only adding to his disastrous legacy by refusing to show the american people any clear goal or any clear plan to end the war. when i am president, i will bring our combat brigades home in 16 months, engage in the direct diplomacy in the region that is necessary to stabilize iraq, restore our military strength, and renew our security and standing in the world. our heroic troops have accomplished every mission that we have given them in iraq and they have done so brilliantly; it is time to bring them home, and to ask the iraqis to take responsibility for their country."</p></span>
