<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- u.s. senator (candidate full) released the following statement today in response to the speech delivered by president bush at the veterans of foreign wars national convention. <p>"the disastrous consequences described by president bush are already in motion and are a direct result of a war that should never have been authorized. there is no military solution to iraq's problems. the only way to reverse these consequences is to change course through a surge in our diplomatic and humanitarian efforts in iraq and the region, and a phased withdrawal of our forces that puts real pressure on the iraqi government to act."</p></span>
