<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- "i am pleased that the louisiana state appeals court recognized that the aggravated battery charge brought in this case was inappropriate. i hope that today's decision will lead the prosecutor to reconsider the excessive charges brought against all the teenagers in this case. and i hope that the judicial process will move deliberately to ensure that all of the defendants will receive a fair trial and equal justice under the law."</span>
