<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- u.s. senator (candidate full) released the following statement today on the jena 6 rally. <p>"today i stand with those who stand for justice in jena. the thousands of americans from every race and region who have descended on this small louisiana town carry forth the legacy of all those who sat at lunch counters and took freedom rides to strike a blow against injustice wherever it may exist. when a noose hangs from a schoolyard tree in the 21st century and young men are treated in a way that is not equal nor just, it is not just an offense to the people of jena or to the african-american community, it is an offense to the ideals we hold as americans. i renew my call for the district attorney to drop the excessive charges filed in this case, and i will continue my decades-long fight against injustice and division as president."</p></span>
