<span class="displaytext">it is fitting that we meet today on the mall of the american legion, surrounded by monuments to our nation's heroes. because on this day, 25 years ago, the marine barracks in beirut were bombed. 241 americans laid down their lives for this country and for the peace they were there to protect. we revere their service. we honor their sacrifice. and we keep their families in our prayers. <p>we will never forget them. </p><p>indiana, in just 12 days, you'll have the chance to elect your next president. and you'll have the chance to bring the change we need to washington. that's the good news. but we're going to have to work, and struggle, and fight for every single one of those 12 days to move our country in a new direction. </p><p>i am hopeful about the outcome. we were thrilled this weekend when a great american statesman, general colin powell, joined our cause. but we cannot let up. and we won't. </p><p>because one thing we know is that change never comes without a fight. in the final days of campaigns, the say-anything, do-anything politics too often takes over. we've seen it before. and we're seeing it again today. the ugly phone calls. the misleading mail and tv ads. the careless, outrageous comments. all aimed at keeping us from working together, all aimed at stopping change. </p><p>well, what we need now is not misleading charges and divisive attacks. what we need is honest leadership and real change, and that's why i'm running for president of the united states. </p><p>now, more than ever, this campaign has to be about the problems facing the american people - because this is a moment of great uncertainty for america. we're facing the worst economic crisis since the great depression. the dow plummeted again yesterday, threatening the job security, retirement security, and economic security of millions of ordinary americans. indiana lost 4,500 manufacturing jobs in september alone. and just today, we learned that more and more americans are filing for unemployment. home values are falling. foreclosures are rising. wages are shrinking. and the cost of health care and college tuition has never been higher. </p><p>and that's what this election is all about - because (candidate full) and i have real differences about how to get us out of this economic mess. you see, senator (candidate last) thinks the economic policies of george w. bush are just right for america. in the senate, he's voted with george bush 90 percent of the time. said earlier this year that we've made "great progress" over the last eight years. and while senator (candidate last) says now that he's different from president bush, you sure couldn't tell by the policies he's proposing. </p><p>just yesterday, senator (candidate last) strongly defended the bush policy of lavishing tax cuts on corporations that ship american jobs overseas. he made the peculiar argument that the best way to stop companies from shipping jobs overseas is to give more tax cuts to companies that ship jobs overseas. more tax cuts for job outsourcers. that's what senator (candidate last) proposed as his answer to outsourcing. </p><p>he said that's - quote - "simple fundamental economics." </p><p>well, indiana, my opponent may call that "fundamental economics," but we know that's just another name for the wall street first, main street last economic philosophy we've had for the past eight years - and that's fundamentally wrong. </p><p>if senator (candidate last) wants to defend tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas, that's his choice. but i say, let's end tax cuts for companies that ship american jobs overseas, and give them to companies that create good jobs right here in indiana - in the united states of america. </p><p>if he wants to defend free trade agreements designed to protect the profits of multinational corporations and a trade policy that lets countries like china tilt the playing field against our workers, that's up to him. but i say, we need a trade policy that protects the dreams of hardworking americans. </p><p>if he wants to defend a tax code that's more than 10,000 pages long and filled with loopholes written in by corporate lobbyists like the ones running his campaign, he's got every right. he has every right to defend offshore tax havens that let companies avoid paying taxes here in america. but i say, it's time to close corporate loopholes, shut offshore tax havens, and restore balance and fairness to our tax code. </p><p>by the way, did you know that there's a building in the cayman islands that supposedly houses 18,000 corporations. that's either the biggest building or the biggest tax scam on record. and i think we know which one it is. </p><p>that's the system my opponent defends. that's the system he wants to preserve. well, indiana, we've tried it (candidate full)'s way. we've tried it george bush's way. and we're here today to say enough is enough. we can't afford four more years of their "fundamental economics." that's why i'm running for president of the united states of america. </p><p>you see, i have a different notion of fundamental economics than my opponent. because where i come from, there's nothing more fundamental than a good-paying job. there's nothing more fundamental than being able to pay your health care bills, put your kids through college, or retire with dignity and security. there's nothing more fundamental than the american dream - and that's the dream we can reclaim if you stand with me on november 4. </p><p>i know we can do this. i know we can steer ourselves out of this crisis. because i believe in you. i believe in the american people. </p><p>we are the united states of america. we are a nation that's faced down war and depression; great challenges and great threats. and at each and every moment, we have risen to meet these challenges - not as (PARTY NAME), not as (PARTY NAME)s, but as americans. with resolve. with confidence. with that fundamental belief that here in america, our destiny is not written for us; it's written by us. that's who we are, and that's the country we need to be right now. </p><p>but indiana, i know this. it will take a new direction. it will take new leadership in washington. it will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last eight years. and that's why i'm running for president of the united states. </p><p>it's time to turn the page on eight years of economic policies that put wall street before main street but ended up hurting both. we need policies that grow our economy from the bottom-up, so that every american, everywhere, has the chance to get ahead. not just the person who owns the factory, but the men and women who work on its floor. because if we've learned anything from this economic crisis, it's that we're all connected; we're all in this together; and we will rise or fall as one nation - as one people. </p><p>the rescue plan that passed the congress was a necessary first step to easing this credit crisis, but if we're going to rebuild this economy from the bottom up, we need an immediate rescue plan for the middle-class - and that's what i will do as president of the united states. </p><p>nine months ago, i called for a stimulus plan to provide immediate relief for states, along with tax rebates to get money directly to middle class families and a foreclosure prevention fund to help people keep their homes. senator (candidate last)'s advisors openly mocked the stimulus plan before congress - one referred to it, and i quote, as "borrowing money from the chinese and dropping it from helicopters." another dismissed it as "junk." </p><p>just this week, after nine straight months of job losses, when our federal reserve chairman supports another stimulus to get our economy moving, senator (candidate last) said he doesn't think we need to pass this stimulus immediately. well, the working families who've been hard hit by this economic crisis - folks who can't pay their mortgages or their medical bills or send their kids to college - they can't afford to go to the back of the line behind ceos and wall street banks. they need help right here, right now - and that's why i'm running for president of the united states. </p><p>i've proposed a new american jobs tax credit for each new employee that companies hire here in the united states over the next two years. and i'll help make sure the fuel-efficient cars of tomorrow are built not just in south korea or japan, but right here in indiana. </p><p>few have been harder hit by our credit crisis than the workers who make our cars and the companies that supply their parts. now, when it came to rescuing wall street, washington didn't waste a minute. but now that auto-workers are suffering, washington's put on the breaks. it turns out it could take a year for the auto industry to get the loan guarantees we passed a few weeks ago. </p><p>well, the workers who are being laid off and the companies that are seeing their sales drop - they can't afford to wait a year, they need help right now. that's why i've called on washington to fast-track those loan guarantees and provide more as needed - because that's how we'll secure our auto jobs and save our auto industry. </p><p>i'll also help small businesses by eliminating capital gains taxes and giving them emergency loans to keep their doors open and hire workers. i'll put a three-month moratorium on foreclosures so that we can give homeowners the breathing room they need to get back on their feet. and i will create a jobs and growth fund to help states and local governments save one million jobs and pay for health care and education without having to raise your taxes. </p><p>these are the steps that we must take - right now - to start getting our economy back on track. but we also need a new set of priorities to grow our economy and create jobs over the long-term. </p><p>it starts with tax relief. there's been a lot of talk about taxes in this campaign. and the truth is, my opponent and i are both proposing tax cuts. the difference is, he wants to give a $700,000 tax cut to the average fortune 500 ceo. i want to put a middle class tax cut in the pockets of 95% of workers and their families. my opponent doesn't want you to know this, but under my plan, tax rates for middle class families will actually be less than they were under ronald reagan. </p><p>it's true that i want to roll back the bush tax cuts on the wealthiest americans and go back to the rate they paid under bill (candidate last). (candidate full) calls that socialism. what he forgets is that just a few years ago, he himself said those bush tax cuts were irresponsible. he said he couldn't "in good conscience" support a tax cut where the benefits went to the wealthy at the expense of "middle class americans who most need tax relief." well, he was right then, and i am right now. </p><p>let me be crystal clear: if you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year - which includes 98% of small business owners - you won't see your taxes increase one single dime. not your payroll taxes, not your income taxes, not your capital gains taxes - nothing. that is my commitment to you. </p><p>for the last eight years, we've given more and more to those with the most and hoped that prosperity would trickle down to everyone else. and guess what? it didn't. so it's time to try something new. it's time to grow this economy from the bottom-up. it's time to invest in the middle-class again. </p><p>if i am president, i will invest $15 billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new, green jobs over the next decade - jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced; jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and fuel-efficient cars; jobs that will help us end our dependence on oil from middle east dictators. </p><p>i'll also put two million more americans to work rebuilding our crumbling roads, schools, and bridges - because it is time to build an american infrastructure for the 21st century. and if people ask how we're going to pay for this, you tell them that if we can spend $10 billion a month in iraq, we can spend some money to rebuild america. </p><p>if i am president, i will finally fix the problems in our health care system that we've been talking about for too long. this issue is personal for me. my mother died of ovarian cancer at the age of 53, and i'll never forget how she spent the final months of her life lying in a hospital bed, fighting with her insurance company because they claimed that her cancer was a pre-existing condition and didn't want to pay for treatment. if i am president, i will make sure those insurance companies can never do that again. </p><p>my health care plan will make sure insurance companies can't discriminate against those who are sick and need care most. if you have health insurance, the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums. if you don't have health insurance, you'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that members of congress get for themselves. and we'll invest in preventative care and new technology to finally lower the cost of health care for families, businesses, and the entire economy. that's the change we need. </p><p>and if i'm president, we'll give every child, everywhere the skills and the knowledge they need to compete with any worker, anywhere in the world. i will not allow countries to out-teach us today so they can out-compete us tomorrow. it is time to provide every american with a world-class education. that means investing in early childhood education. that means recruiting an army of new teachers, and paying them better, and giving them more support in exchange for higher standards and more accountability. </p><p>and it means investing in agricultural education. from seeing all those blue corduroy jackets in the crowd, i know there's a future farmers of america convention here in indianapolis. and i want you to know that if i'm elected president, i will fight for you - because america's farmers are america's future. and it's time we had a president who understood that. </p><p>we need to make sure every american who has the drive and the will but not the money can go to college. my opponent's top economic advisor actually said that they have no plan to invest in college affordability because we can't have a giveaway to every special interest. well i don't think the young people of america are a special interest - they are the future of this country. that's why i'll make this deal with you: if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford your tuition. no ifs, ands or buts. you invest in america, america will invest in you, and together, we will move this country forward. </p><p>now, make no mistake: the change we need won't come easy or without cost. we will all need to tighten our belts, we will all need to sacrifice and we will all need to pull our weight because now more than ever, we are all in this together. </p><p>at a defining moment like this, we don't have the luxury of relying on the same political games and the same political tactics that are used every election to divide us from one another and make us afraid of one another. with the challenges and crises we face right now, we cannot afford to divide this country by class or region; by who we are or what policies we support. </p><p>there are no real or fake parts of this country. we are not separated by the pro-america and anti-america parts of this nation - we all love this country, no matter where we live or where we come from. there are patriots who supported this war in iraq and patriots who opposed it; patriots who believe in (PARTY NAME) policies and those who believe in (PARTY NAME) policies. the men and women from indiana and all across america who serve on our battlefields may be (PARTY NAME) and (PARTY NAME)s and independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag. they have not served a red america or a blue america - they have served the united states of america. </p><p>we have always been at our best when we've had leadership that called us to look past our differences and come together as one nation, as one people; leadership that rallied this entire country to a common purpose - to a higher purpose. and i am running for president of the united states of america because that is the country we need to be right now. </p><p>this country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in nearly a century. and future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test. will they say that this was a time when america lost its way and its purpose? when we allowed the same divisions and fear tactics and our own petty differences to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession? </p><p>or will they say that this was another one of those moments when america overcame? when we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other's success? </p><p>this is one of those moments. i realize you're cynical and fed up with politics. i understand that you're disappointed and even angry with your leaders. you have every right to be. but despite all of this, i ask of you what's been asked of the american people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history. i ask you to believe - to believe in yourselves, in each other, and in the future we can build together. </p><p>together, we cannot fail. not now. not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save. not when there are so many americans without jobs and without homes. not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor, or send their child to college, or pay their bills at the end of the month. not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves. </p><p>we can do this. americans have done this before. some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe i can't go to college but my child can; maybe i can't have my own business but my child can. i may have to rent, but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own. i may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for senate. i might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the united states of america. </p><p>now it falls to us. together, we cannot fail. and i need you to make it happen. if you want the next four years looking like the last eight, then i am not your candidate. but if you want real change - if you want an economy that rewards work, and that works for main street and wall street; if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs; if you want health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete; then i ask you to knock on some doors, make some calls, talk to your neighbors, and give me your vote. in indiana, you can vote early right here, and right now. to find out how, just go to voteforchange.com. and if you stand with me, i promise you - we will win indiana, we will win this election, and then you and i - together - will change this country and change this world. thank you, god bless you, and may god bless america.</p></span>
