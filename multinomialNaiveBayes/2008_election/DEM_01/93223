<span class="displaytext">las vegas, nv- the (candidate last) campaign released the following statement from (candidate full): <p>"we're proud of the campaign we ran in nevada. we came from over twenty-five points behind to win more national convention delegates than (candidate full) because we performed well all across the state, including rural areas where (PARTY NAME) have traditionally struggled. the reason is because tens of thousands of nevadans came out to say that they're tired of business-as-usual in washington and ready for a president who can bring this country together, take on the lobbyists and special interests, and end the politics of saying and doing whatever it takes to win an election. it is the kind of politics that feeds our cynicism and distracts us from taking on the real challenges facing america - an economy that's left working families struggling, a broken health care system, and a war in iraq that must end. </p><p>"we ran an honest, uplifting campaign in nevada that focused on the real problems americans are facing, a campaign that appealed to people's hopes instead of their fears. that's the campaign we'll take to south carolina and across america in the weeks to come, and that's how we will truly bring about the change this country is hungry for." </p><p>the (candidate last) campaign released the following statement from (candidate last) campaign manager david plouffe: </p><p>"we currently have reports of over 200 separate incidents of trouble at caucus sites, including doors being closed up to thirty minutes early, registration forms running out so people were turned away, and id being requested and checked in a non-uniform fashion. this is in addition to the (candidate last) campaign's efforts to confuse voters and call into question the at-large caucus sites which clearly had an affect on turnout at these locations. these kinds of (candidate last) campaign tactics were part of an entire week's worth of false, divisive, attacks designed to mislead caucus-goers and discredit the caucus itself. </p><p>"we will investigate all of these thoroughly and would encourage anyone who had concern about actions at the caucus sites to call (866) 675-2008."</p></span>
