(candidate full) offers the best chance to take back the white house, elect countless (PARTY NAME) down-ballot, and breathe new life into the (PARTY NAME) party." </p><p>jeanette council said, "i am pleased today to be endorsing (candidate full) as he continues to unite americans for change. this election is a unique opportunity for all americans and (candidate full)'s campaign has inspired and changed the entire face of our country. his campaign has mobilized new people and welcomed people of all ages, races, backgrounds, attracted everyone from first time voters to voters who have participated their entire adult lives. the way he has built a campaign that reflects his message of hope and change and brought all different communities to the table is unlike any campaign i have ever seen." </p><p>council added, "i am first and foremost a (PARTY NAME) and the (PARTY NAME) party is truly the party of the people, the party of inclusion that wants to engage all people in the political process. this is what (candidate full) has done. seeing this happen, especially here in north carolina, has changed me forever and given me hope that we can change this country. i put much thought, consideration and most importantly prayer into this decision, and today i know i am backing a candidate who can put our country on the right path. i'm proud to endorse him today."</p></span>
