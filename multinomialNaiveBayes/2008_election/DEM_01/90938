<span class="displaytext">chicago, il -- u.s. (candidate full) today released the following statement on ahmadinejad's appearance at columbia university in new york today. <p>"i would not have extended an invitation to give president ahmadinejad another platform for his hateful rhetoric. adolph hitler was the worst mass murderer in the history of the world, and ahmadinejad's denial of his crimes is offensive to jews, to americans, and to all people of goodwill. but this is america, and we should never be afraid to confront the ranting lies of dictators like ahmadinejad with the power of truth and the strength of our own values. what ahmadinejad will learn while he's here is that america is united in rejection of his hateful views, and in opposition to the iranian government's support of terrorism and pursuit of nuclear weapons."</p></span>
